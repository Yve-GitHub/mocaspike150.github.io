		<p>At the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA), a national cultural institution that tells the untold stories in the
			making of America through the lens of the Chinese immigrant experience, visitors are greeted with the Chinese
			proverb: “<em>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</em>” It is our way of honoring the
			pioneering spirit of not only Chinese immigrants but all immigrants who sacrificed and dared to take the first
			step that blazed a path for future generations in America.</p>
		<p>In 2019, MOCA celebrates the 150th anniversary of the historic moment when a golden spike was driven into the
			ground at Promontory Summit in Utah to mark the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. To commemorate this
			milestone, MOCA has launched the <strong>MOCA Spike 150 initiative</strong> to honor the resilience, grit, and
			ingenuity symbolized by the thousands of laborers — many of whom were of Chinese ancestry — who toiled and gave
			their lives to build America into the country it is today. This nine-month journey will allow MOCA to tell 150
			untold stories in the making of America as participants of MOCA Spike 150 run across the country culminating in
			the TCS NYC Marathon on November 3, 2019. MOCA welcomes you to join us in this unprecedented initiative, and
			welcomes runners to follow in the footsteps of this country’s first pioneers and make history.</p>
