<p>Founded in 1980, the <a href="http://www.mocanyc.org/">Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA)</a> is dedicated to preserving and presenting the history, heritage, culture and diverse experiences of people of Chinese descent in the United States. The greatly expanded MOCA at 215 Centre Street, New York is a national home for the precious narratives of diverse Chinese American communities, and strives to be a model among interactive museums.</p>
<p>The Museum promotes dialogue and understanding among people of all cultural backgrounds, bringing 160 years of Chinese American history to vivid life through its innovative exhibitions, educational and cultural programs. MOCA welcomes diverse visitors and participants to its broad array of exhibits and programs. MOCA’s expansion accommodates its range of visitors which include: New Yorkers, domestic and international visitors, neighborhood residents, students and school groups from local and regional schools.</p>
<p>In 2018, MOCA participated in the TCS New York City Marathon as a charitable partner for the first time. Our team of seven runners raised $88,000 to support MOCA’s mission. Many running groups and runners learned about our fundraising effort and showed their support. We are grateful to them for helping to further our mission in telling the story of the Chinese experience in America! This year we hope to reach a larger demographic and raise even more funds to support our work.</p>
