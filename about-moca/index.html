    <p>Founded in 1980, the <a href="http://www.mocanyc.org/">Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA)</a> is dedicated to preserving and presenting the history, heritage, culture and diverse experiences of people of Chinese descent in the United States. The greatly expanded MOCA at 215 Centre Street is a national home for the precious narratives of diverse Chinese American communities, and strives to be a model among interactive museums.</p>
<p>The Museum promotes dialogue and understanding among people of all cultural backgrounds, bringing 160 years of Chinese American history to vivid life through its innovative exhibitions, educational and cultural programs. MOCA welcomes diverse visitors and participants to its broad array of exhibits and programs. MOCA’s expansion accommodates its range of visitors which include: New Yorkers, domestic and international visitors, neighborhood residents, students and school groups from local and regional schools.</p>
<p>Last year, MOCA began participating in the TCS New York City Marathon as a charitable partner. Our team of seven runners raised $88,000 to support MOCA’s mission. Many Chinese American running groups and runners learned about our efforts and showed their support. We are grateful to them for helping to further our mission in presenting the stories of Chinese Americans! This year we hope to reach a larger demographic and raise even more funds to support our work.</p>

<em>TCS NYC Marathon MOCA Charity Team 2018</em></p>
<p>This year will be the 150th anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. To commemorate the contributions of the thousands of Chinese laborers responsible for this milestone in American history, MOCA has named its 2019 TCS NYC Marathon fundraising initiative “<strong>MOCA Spike 150 &#8211; Running Forward with Our Stories!</strong>”  We invite fellow runners and non-runners alike to participate in this initiative.  We encourage everyone to help tell the story of some of the first Chinese in America by helping to support our 2019 marathon team and rewriting history to acknowledge their contributions.</p>
<p>The MOCA Spike 150 initiative is being led by MOCA Board Co-Chair Jonathan Chu and Bergen Runners founder and Captain Renny Shih.  MOCA Spike 150 kicked off with a <a href="/2019/02/13/moca-spike-150-year-a-run-for-the-pig/">pig run</a>, a half marathon course around lower Manhattan in the shape of a pig, to commemorate the Lunar New Year and will culminate in the MOCA team crossing the finish line at the 2019 TCS NYC Marathon. During the nearly yearlong initiative, MOCA will organize a symbolic relay event to represent the building of the railroad that will involve Chinese American running groups from across the country.  In addition to the symbolic relay we are planning to tell the stories of 150 significant Chinese Americans or events in Chinese American history, creating a MOCA TCS NYC Marathon runner database, recruiting runners to participating in the New York City marathon as a member of the MOCA Team (this participation will not conflict with runner&#8217;s Affiliated Club at NYRR).  The funds raised by the MOCA Team will be used to support the museum in fulfilling its mission of preserving the history of Chinese Americans and achieving our goal of becoming a nationally recognized institution. We hope that this initiative will unite Chinese American from all across the country and show our impact on the grand scheme of Americana.</p>
