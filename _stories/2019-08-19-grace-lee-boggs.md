  <p>Grace Lee Boggs (1915-2015) was an American social activist, author, philosopher, and feminist. Her political involvement encompassed many of the major 20 th century U.S. social movements: Labor, Civil Rights, Black Power, Asian American Rights, Women’s Rights, and Environmental Justice. Boggs entered Barnard College on a scholarship to study philosophy and graduated in 1935. She went onto receive her PhD in philosophy from Bryn Mawr College in 1940.</p>
  <p>Due to race and gender barriers of the 1940s, Boggs took a low paying job at the University of Chicago Philosophy Library, this was where she first became involved in tenants’ rights and joined leftist political groups. She would spend her lifetime channeling her studies of Marx, Hegel, and Kant into prolific political writing and grassroots social activism, especially in the African American community, ultimately aligning herself with nonviolent strategies. While Boggs and her husband collaborated with many notable activists and figures, including Malcom X, C.L.R. James, and Raya Dunayevskaya, they later split from their contemporaries to focus on their own grassroots efforts in the community. Boggs’ activist manifesto shied away from upheaval and emphasized community organizing and resurgent moral values, which she actively pursued till her death at the age of 100.</p>

  <p>Grace Lee Boggs(1915-2015)是美国社会活动家、作家、哲学家和女权主义者。她参与的政治活动包括许多20世纪美国主要的社会运动：劳工、民权、黑人权力、亚裔美国人权利、妇女权利和环境公平风险。Boggs获得奖学金进入巴纳德学院（Barnard College）学习哲学，并于1935年毕业。1940年，她在布林莫尔学院（Bryn Mawr College）获得哲学博士学位。</p>
  <p>由于20世纪40年代的种族和性别的障碍，Boggs在芝加哥大学哲学图书馆（University of Chicago Philosophy Library）找到了一份薪水很低的工作，在这里她第一次参与租户权利活动，并加入了左翼政治团体。她终其一生致力于将她对马克思、黑格尔和康德的研究转化为多产的政治著作和基层社会活动，尤其是在非裔美国人社区，最终使自己与非暴力策略保持一致。虽然Boggs和她的丈夫与许多著名的活动家和名人合作，包括Malcom X, C.L.R. James和Raya Dunayevskaya，但他们后来却与这些人分道扬镳，以专注于自己在社区的基层工作。Boggs的活动家宣言避开了激变，并强调社区组织和复兴的道德价值观，她积极追求这一切，直到100岁去世。</p>
