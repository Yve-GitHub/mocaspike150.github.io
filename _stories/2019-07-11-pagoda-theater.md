  <p>The Pagoda Theater (11 East Broadway) was opened on June 1st 1964. While the other movie theaters in Chinatown were not explicitly constructed for film showing but rather modified after the fact, the Pagoda Theater was designed to screen movies. The theater was owned by the Catherine Corporation helmed by Lucas Liang. Liang commissioned China-born architect Poy Gum Lee to construct the theater, the last building to be designed by Lee in New York’s Chinatown. The theater’s first movie was an opera by the name of Chin Hueng Ling. The theater was one of the first of the wave of theaters to close in the early 90s and was quickly demolished after shuttering its doors in 1992.</p>

  <p>金都戏院（东百老汇大道11号）于1964年6月1日开始营业。当时唐人街的其他电影院初建时并没有明确是为放映电影，而是在之后见机行事改建成电影院，但是金都戏院的设计初衷就是放映电影。戏院归凯瑟琳公司（Catherine Corporation）所有，由卢卡斯·梁（Lucas Liang）掌管。梁先生委托出生于中国的建筑师李锦沛（Poy Gum Lee）来建造这座戏院，这是李锦沛在纽约唐人街设计的最后一座建筑。这家戏院放映的第一部电影是一部歌剧，名字叫《Chin Hueng Ling》。该戏院是90年代初首批关闭的戏院之一，1992年关闭后很快被拆除。</p>
