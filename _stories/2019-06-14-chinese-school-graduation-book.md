  <p>In 1909, the New York Chinese School opened on Mott Street as the very first overseas Chinese school. Its original class consisted of only twenty students, but today the school serves more than 3,000. Located in the Chinese Community Centre along with the CCBA, the school is a non-profit, community-based organization and has been chartered by the New York State Education Department since 1967. Today, the New York Chinese School provides afterschool and weekend Chinese education for students K-12 and for adults, spanning from language to poetry, calligraphy, and performing arts. While the school opened with Chinese students in mind, today the rise of China as a global economy and parents’ desire to give their students a leg up through a Mandarin education has resulted in a rise of students from a variety of backgrounds learning at the school.</p>
  <p>The above yearbook for the 1951 graduating class includes students’ and teachers’ portraits, class photos, essays written by the students, and candid photographs of student life. In the beginning of the yearbook, teachers express their concerns over the political turmoil overseas and the intense educational expectations for their students. They describe how China’s belief in education as the foundation of a country makes their task to not only educate their students but foster in them a family-country collective consciousness. Photographs of field trips, sports, speech competitions, and other games contrast these serious messages, along with student speeches, argumentative essays, letters, prose, and even a note asking for leave.</p>

  <p>1909年，纽约中文学校在勿街开办，成为最早的海外华人学校。最初的班级只收到20名学生，但现在学校有3000多名学生。位于华人社区中心，跟纽约中华公所(CCBA)在一起，该学校是一所以社区为基础的非营利机构，自1967年起得到纽约州教育局特许。目前，纽约中文学校为K-12年级的学生和成年人提供放学后和周末的中文教育，课程从语言到诗歌、书法和表演艺术。虽然学校是本来是为中国学生开办的，但今天中国作为一个全球经济大国而崛起，家长们都想让自己的孩子通过学习中文提高自己，于是不断有各种背景的学生来到学校学习。</p>
  <p>上述1951年的毕业纪念册包括学生和老师的肖像照、班级集体照、学生写的文章和学生的日常生活照。在纪念册的开头，老师们表达了对海外政治动荡的担忧和对他们的学生强烈的教育期望。他们写到中国对于教育作为一个国家的基础的信念是如何使他们的工作不仅仅是教育他们的学生，也是培养他们的学生一个家庭与国家的集体意识。实地考察、体育运动、讲演比赛和其他游戏的照片与这些严肃的话题形成鲜明的对比，还有学生的演讲、辩论的文章、书信、散文，甚至是请假条。</p>
