He painted in the California Style of Watercolor Painting, which was defined by broad brush
strokes and rich colors. He was born in Oakland, California as Dong Moy Shu in 1911. At the
age of 5 his parents moved the family to Hong Kong, where he began school.As per Chinese
naming traditions, he was given the name “King Man” (in Cantonese the name literally means
“Scenery Composition”) by his instructor after learning of his artistic aspirations. He would later
combine the name and put his surname in front taking on the name Dong Kingman.</p>
  <p>In his teens he would move back to the United States and attended the Fox Morgan Art School
in Oakland. It was during that time that Kingman decided to concentrate on watercolor
painting. In 1936 Kingman had his first solo exhibition at the San Francisco Art Association.
This show gained him acclaim and recognition. During World War II he was drafted into the
U.S. Army but was transferred to map making role at the Office of Strategic Service because
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a fan of his work. After the war he went on to design
background for Hollywood, most notably the film adaptation of “Flower Drum Song.” He
