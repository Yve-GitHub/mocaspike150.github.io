  <p>The Transfiguration Church represents a centuries-old cause to overcome the limits of language to serve immigrants of faith. While the first Lutherans to arrive in New York attended Dutch-speaking churches without issue, German Lutherans who came to outnumber the Dutch eight to one were unable to petition for services in German. They established their own German-speaking church, only for their English-speaking descendants to experience the same language barrier not fifty years later. In 1801, these English-speaking parishioners broke ground for their own church, which would eventually become the Transfiguration Church. The church has evolved from Lutheran to Episcopal to Roman Catholic over the years, adapting its services first for Irish, then Italian, and finally Chinese immigrant communities of the notorious “Five Points.” Today, services are held in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.</p>

  <p>天主教显圣容堂（The Transfiguration Church）代表了一个有着数百年历史的存在，它克服语言的限制来为有信仰的移民服务。尽管第一批达到纽约的路德派教徒去荷兰语的教堂毫无语言障碍，但德国路德派教徒的人数超过了荷兰路德派教徒的八倍，却无法申请德语服务。他们建立了自己的德语教堂，只为他们说英语的后代无须在50年后再体验相似的语言障碍。1801年，这些说英语的教友为他们自己的教堂破土动工，最终成为天主教显圣容堂（The Transfiguration Church）。多年来，这间教堂从路德教会发展到圣公会，再发展到罗马天主教会，先是为爱尔兰人服务，然后是意大利人，最后是臭名昭著的五点地区（Five Points）华人移民社区。如今，它提供英语、粤语和普通话服务。</p>
