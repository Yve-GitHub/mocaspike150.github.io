  <p>The Sun Sing Theatre was a movie theater located at 75-85 East Broadway directly under the Manhattan Bridge in New York’s Chinatown. Along with a select few Chinese language theaters, the Sun Sing Theatre offered the rare opportunity for Chinese immigrants to safely socialize, connect back to home, learn about the previous generation’s culture, or participate in the movie-going craze in their native language.</p>
  <p>The theater first opened in 1911 as the Florence Theater, which was home to Yiddish vaudeville and motion pictures. As the neighborhood demographic changed, the theater’s content evolved. In 1942, it was renamed the New Canton and began featuring Chinese opera performance. A professional Hong Kong opera troupe that was stranded in New York during World War II helped keep the theater alive over ten years with nightly performances. In 1950, it transitioned into showing motion pictures exclusively and was renamed for the last time to Sun Sing Theater.</p>
  <p>In 1960, the city planned to add an upper deck to the Manhattan Bridge and scheduled the theater for demolition. But engineers were able to save the historic theater, reducing the seating from about 900 down to a little less than 700 to make space for bridge supports. The theater brought back stage performances in 1972 in an attempt to compete with other growing entertainment markets like karaoke, gambling, Chinese-language programs on cable television, and eventually video rentals. Sun Sing Theatre closed in 1993, along with many of its kin.</p>
  <p>MOCA salvaged a number of artifacts from the theater, including tickets, signage, stamps, uniforms, and a board of handwritten title cards used to track film shipments to various theaters.</p>

  <p>新声戏院是一家电影院，坐落在纽约唐人街曼哈顿大桥正下方的东百老汇大街75-85号。和其他几家为数不多的中文电影院一起，新声影院为中国移民提供了难得的场所，可以让他们安心地进行社交活动，与家乡保持联系，了解上一代人的文化，或者追母语电影。</p>
  <p>这座剧院于1911年开业，当时叫做佛罗伦萨剧院，用来进行意第绪歌舞杂耍表演和电影播放。随着社区人口结构的变化，剧院的演出也发生了变化。1942年，它改名为“新广州”，并开始上演中国戏曲。第二次世界大战期间，滞留在纽约的一个专业的香港歌剧团通过夜间演出将剧院维持了十多年。1950年，它转变为只放映电影的剧院，并最后一次更名为新声戏院。</p>
  <p>1960年，纽约市计划在曼哈顿大桥上加建一层桥面，并计划拆除剧院。但是工程师们挽救了这座历史悠久的剧院，他们将座位从900个减少到不足700个，为桥梁支架腾出了空间。1972年，剧院恢复了舞台表演，试图与其他日益增长的娱乐市场竞争，比如卡拉OK、赌博、有线电视中文节目以及后来的视频租赁等。1993年，新声剧院关闭了，连同其他的许多类似的剧院一起。</p>
  <p>MOCA从剧院中抢救了一些文物，包括门票、标牌、印章、制服和一整块板子，上面用手写的片名卡片记录了电影运往各个电影院的跟踪情况。</p>
