  <p>Jay Chou is a Taiwanese singer, songwriter, record and film producer, director, and actor. He released his first album titled Jay in 2000 at the age of 21. While the album was well received it wasn’t until a year later when he released his sophomore album “Fantasy,” that he became a bona fide star. At the time, his music was dramatically different than the other types of mainstream mandarin pop; including themes and his vocal delivery. To date he has released 14 albums.</p>
  <p>With his huge following in Asian it would come as no surprise that Hollywood would try to tap into his popularity. Chou would make his Hollywood debut in 2011 in the modern day remake of “The Green Hornet,” where he played Kato (a role formerly played by Bruce Lee in the 1960s Television iteration) costarring alongside Seth Rogan’s Green Hornet. The movie was panned by critics but ultimately made a profit. While Chou has never been tapped to play another major role, he has made in appearance in 2016’s “Now You See Me 2.”</p>

  <p>周杰伦是一位台湾歌手、词曲作家、唱片和电影制作人、导演以及演员。2000年，21岁的周杰伦发行了自己的第一张专辑《Jay》。尽管这张专辑很受欢迎，但直到一年后，他才发行了他的第二张专辑《范特西》，从此真正成为了一个明星。那个时候，他的音乐和其他主流华语流行音乐截然不同，包括音乐主题和他的声音表达。到目前为止，他已经发行了14张专辑。</p>
  <p>由于他在亚洲拥有庞大的粉丝群，因此好莱坞试图想要利用他的人气也就不足为奇了。2011年，周杰伦在《青蜂侠》（The Green Hornet）的现代翻拍版中首次亮相好莱坞，他在片中饰演加藤（李小龙在上世纪60年代的电视剧中曾饰演过这个角色），与青蜂侠扮演者塞斯罗根（Seth Rogan）联袂主演。虽然这部电影受到了评论家的严厉批评，但最终还是盈利了。随后周杰伦出演了2016年的电影《惊天魔盗团2》，尽管他不再担任重要角色。</p>
