  <p>Fred Ho (1957-2014) was a radical activist, writer, and groundbreaking musician best known for his developments in the field of Afro-Asian American music. After a childhood spent trying to assimilate to the white culture of his Massachusetts College town, Ho read the ideas of Malcolm X for the first time in high school and began forging his political consciousness around dismantling capitalism, imperialism, and white supremacy. A self-taught saxophonist, Ho steadfastly sought to create an Asian American musical identity that was a true radical and multicultural synthesis, discrediting the label of “jazz” as a pejorative European label.</p>
  <p>Ho’s music and lifestyle where intrinsically intertwined facets of his dedication to ecosocialism, matriarchy, indigeneity, and creativity. Over his short lifetime, Ho was a grassroots activist, community organizer, political theorist, and creator of several ground breaking Chinese American “jazz” operas and musical works. His projects were recognized and sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Duke Ellington Distinguished Artist Lifetime Achievement Award, among others. Ho was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2006 and spent his eight-year battle against the disease as a metaphoric lens to sharpen his political philosophies, discussed in his books Diary of a Radical Cancer Warrior and Raw Extreme Manifesto.</p>

  <p>侯维翰的音乐和生活方式本质上是将他对生态社会主义、母权制、独立性和创造性的贡献交织在一起。在他短暂的一生中，他是一位草根活动家、社区组织者、政治理论家，及一些开创性的美国华人“爵士” 歌剧和音乐作品的创作者。他的项目得到了美国国家艺术基金会、洛克菲勒基金会、古根海姆基金会和艾灵顿公爵杰出艺术家终身成就奖等机构的认可和赞助。侯维翰于2006年被诊断出患有结肠癌，他用八年时间与结肠癌作斗争，就像一个隐喻的镜头，锐化了他的政治哲学，在他的著作《激进抗癌斗士日记》（Diary of a Radical Cancer Warrior）和《生食极端主义宣言》（Raw Extreme Manifesto）中进行了讨论。</p>
