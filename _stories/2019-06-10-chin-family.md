  <p>In the 1930s, Dong Wong purchased Sam Wah Laundry, located on Creston Street in the Bronx, NY. Due to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the hand laundry was one of the few accessible businesses that allowed Chinese immigrants to make a living, although the trade required many to work extremely arduous hours around the clock. The laundry remained family owned until 1982, when the family decided to close the business and move to New Jersey after husband and owner Quock Chin was killed in an attempted robbery. Prior to shuttering the doors, Mrs. Quock Chin contacted MOCA’s staff and offered its contents to the museum’s first project about Chinese laundry workers, <i>Eight Pound Livelihood</i>. MOCA helped Mrs. Quock Chin and her family close up shop and conducted interviews and documented the historical site. Such personal connections within and from the community are what have fueled MOCA’s mission and work since its inception.</p>

  <p>二十世纪30年代，Dong Wong收购了位于纽约布朗克斯区克雷斯顿街上的Sam Wah洗衣店。由于受到1882年施行的排华法案的影响，手工洗衣店是为数不多的允许华人移民工作谋生的行当之一，尽管这份工作要求工人们没日没夜地工作。这家洗衣房由Chin氏家族经营，直到1982年决定关门并举家迁往新泽西，这是因为不久前Chin家的丈夫、洗衣店的主人Quock Chin不幸在一起抢劫案中遇害。在关门之前，Quock Chin的太太联系到MOCA的员工，并将洗衣店的东西捐赠给MOCA的第一个项目“八磅生涯”，一个关于华人洗衣工人的展览。MOCA帮助Chin太太和她的家人关闭了洗衣店，作了口述历史的采访以及拍摄了洗衣店。这种跟社区之间的紧密关系是MOCA自创建以来一直恪守的信条，推动了MOCA的使命和工作。</p>
