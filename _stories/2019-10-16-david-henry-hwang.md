  <p>A titan of the American theater, David Henry Hwang has written several highly acclaimed dramas, opera libretti, and screenplays. Hwang’s accolades include being a Tony-award winner for his 1988 play <i>M. Butterfly</i>, a three-time Obie Award recipient for many of his off-Broadway plays, two Grammy prizes (one of which he co-wrote with the late pop icon Prince), and Pultizer Prize finalist for <i>Yellow Face</i> and <i>M. Butterfly</i>. Other awards include his nomination to former President Bill Clinton’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities as well as his participation on the board of the Lark Play Development Center. Many of Hwang’s stories recount the intricacies of being Chinese and American and the struggle to reconcile one’s identity in a changing world. In 2011, he wrote the play <i>Chinglish</i>, which was about an American businessman trying to break into the Chinese market. The play explores the complexities of Chinese culture that go dar beyond simply understanding the language. 
  <p>From discussing Chinese railroad strikes via opera libretti to unpacking the problems of racial type-casting in <i>Yellow Face</i>, Hwang remains a prominent leader in presenting the Chinese-American immigrant experience. He is currently the head of playwriting at Columbia University School of the Arts and chair of the American Theater Wing, which is the founding organization for the Tony Awards. For future works, Hwang is preparing a live-action musical of <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i> for Disney Studios and is touring his new play <i>Soft Power</i> alongside musical composer Jeanine Tesori.</p>

  <p>作为美国戏剧界的巨子，黄哲伦（David Henry Hwang）写过几部广受好评的戏剧、歌剧剧本和影视剧本。黄哲伦获得的奖项包括凭借1988年的戏剧《蝴蝶君》（<i>M. Butterfly</i>）获得托尼奖（Tony Award），凭借多部外百老汇戏剧获得三次奥比奖（Obie Award），获得两次格莱美奖（Grammy prizes），其中一次是他与已故的流行偶像普林斯（Prince）共同创作的，以及凭借《黄面佬》（<i>Yellow Face</i>）和《蝴蝶君》（<i>M. Butterfly</i>）入围普利策奖（Pultizer Prize）决赛。其他荣誉包括他被提名为前总统比尔克林顿的艺术与人文委员会成员，以及他加入云雀剧作发展中心（Lark Play Development Center）董事会。黄哲伦的许多故事都讲述了身为中国人和美国人的错综复杂，以及在不断变化的世界中如何努力调和自己的身份。2011年，黄哲伦创作的百老汇剧目《中式英语》讲述了一位美国企业家试图闯入中国市场的故事。这部剧探索了中国文化方方面面分复杂的关系，远远超过了仅仅是对语言的简单理解。
  <p>从通过歌剧剧本讨论华人铁路罢工，到《黄面佬》中揭示种族类型演员的问题，黄哲伦一直都是展现美国华人移民经历的杰出领袖。目前，他是哥伦比亚大学艺术学院剧本写作部的负责人，以及托尼奖的创始机构美国剧院之翼（American Theater Wing）的主席。对于未来的作品，黄哲伦正在为迪士尼影业公司准备真人版音乐剧《钟楼怪人》（<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>），并与音乐作曲家Jeanine Tesori一起巡演他的新剧《软实力》（<i>Soft Power</i>）。</p>
