  <p>Fay Chiang (1952-2017) was a poet, visual artist, and community and cultural organizer who worked primarily in New York City’s Chinatown and the Lower East Side for more than 45 years. Raised in the backroom of a laundry in Queens by immigrant parents from Guandong, China, she wrote from her experiences as a woman of color from the working class. She believed culture was a weapon to reclaim our past, define our present, and to envision possibilities for our future.</p>
  <p>Chiang directed the Basement Workshop, a seminal Asian American multi-disciplinary arts initiative in the early 70s that left a lasting imprint on Asian American arts and culture on the East Coast and beyond. She was a long term cancer survivor and peacefully passed in her sleep on a Friday morning in October 2017.</p>

  <p>Fay Chiang（1952-2017）是一名诗人，视觉艺术家和社区文化组织者，她曾在纽约中国城和下东区工作超过45年。她从小在皇后区的一家洗衣房的后室中由她的父母抚养长大，她的父母是来自中国广东的移民。她的创作取材于她作为一个工人阶级有色人种女性的生活经历。她相信文化是我们唤醒过去、定义现在和展望未来的武器。</p>
  <p>Chiang女士曾担任地下室工作坊的主席。地下室工作坊是70年代初的一个开创性的亚裔美国人多学科艺术项目——在东海岸及其延伸地区的亚裔美国人文化艺术方面留下了持久的影响。她患癌症很长时间，于2017年10月的一个周五早上在睡梦中平静离世。</p>
