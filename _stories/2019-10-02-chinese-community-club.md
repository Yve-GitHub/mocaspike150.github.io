  <p>The Chinese community club was an idea conceived by a group of Chinatown business men and community leaders to support youth activities.  The group was officially started in May of 1945 with one of the main goals being to raise $300,000 in five years in order to erect a community and recreation center in Chinatown.  The club’s membership and sponsored activities were limited to males only; it is unclear whether this policy changed as the organization evolved.  The club went on to sponsor many of the teams that were active through the Church of All Nations.  They began sponsors of the “Chinatown Midgets” basketball team after they famously won the Police Athletic League championship midget basketball tournament in 1945 after a 25 game winning streak.</p>

  <p>华人社区俱乐部（Chinese community club，简称CCC）是一群华埠商人和社区领袖为支持青年活动而构想出来的。该组织于1945年5月正式成立，其主要目标之一是在五年内筹集30万美元，在唐人街建立一个社区和娱乐中心。该俱乐部的会员以及所赞助的活动仅限男性参加；目前尚不清楚这一政策是否有随着组织的发展而变化。该组织后来赞助了许多活跃在万国教会的球队。在唐人街矮人队经历25连胜而赢得1945年纽约警署体育联盟矮人篮球冠军赛而声名大涨后，华人社区俱乐部（CCC）开始了对他们的资助。</p>
