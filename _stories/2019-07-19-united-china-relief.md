  <p>In 1937, a dispute broke out between Japanese and Chinese troops near Peking, China. This dispute escalated into a military conflict and marked the beginning of the second-Sino Japanese War. The war destroyed and displaced many Chinese citizens. Most of the displaced had nowhere to go or no way of supporting themselves. As a result, several organizations popped up in the United States led by Americans sympathetic to the plight of the Chinese. In the 1940s, seven of these organizations joined forces to establish the United China Relief. The organization send aid workers to China and aimed to raise $5,000,000 to help the Chinese affected by the war. Almost half of the funds would go directly to medical aid while the rest would be divided into quality of life improvements like training new leaders and taking care of war orphaned children.</p>
  <p>The United China Relief even put out a short booklet titled “What Li Wen Saw.” It follows the narrator Li Wen as he recounts the plight of the Chinese people that he witnessed with his own eyes. The booklet ends with a call for help and an explanation of the organization.</p>

  <p>1937年，中日两国军队在中国北京附近爆发了一场争端。这一争端升级为军事冲突，标志着第二次中日战争的开始。战争摧毁许多中国公民的家园并使其流离失所。他们中的大多数人都无处可去，也没有办法养活自己。因此，美国涌现出了几个由美国人领导的组织，同情中国人所处的困境。20世纪40年代，其中7个组织联合起来成立了美国援华联合会。该组织向中国派遣援助人员，旨在筹集500万美元来帮助受战争影响的中国人。近一半的资金将直接用于医疗援助，其余资金将分别用于提高生活质量，如培训新领导人和照顾战争孤儿等方面。</p>
  <p>美国援华联合会甚至发布了一本名为《What Li Wen Saw》的小册子。它记录了叙述者Li Wen讲述的他所亲眼目睹的中国人民的困境。小册子的结尾是寻求帮助的呼吁和对该组织的解释说明。</p>
