  <p>Helen Zia is a Chinese-American journalist and activist for Asian American and LGBT rights. Zia graduated from Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where she was a founding member of its Asian American Students Association and a member of its first graduating class of women. Zia was living in Detroit when Vincent Chin was murdered in 1982. While the Detroit area did not have a very organized Asian American movement at the time, Zia’s journalism and advocacy work played a critical role in bringing federal civil rights charges against the perpetrators, who were to serve no jail time and pay only $3,000 in fines after state criminal charges had been pressed. This would be the first time in U.S. history that the government acted on behalf of an Asian American in a civil rights case. Zia’s work galvanized the Asian American community in response to the crime, marking the first mass movement where Chinese Americans and other Asian ethnicities united to form a unified Asian American voice, in coalition with other minority groups. Zia’s involvement in the case amounted to a critical turning point for Asian American civil rights and hate crime legislation. Throughout her career, Zia has won awards for her groundbreaking journalism and has been a staunch advocate for civil rights, women’s rights, and LGBT rights. In 2008, she allowed reporters to cover her wedding ceremony to her partner of 16 years in order to show that “this fundamental issue of equality and human dignity affects our Asian American communities too.”</p>

  <p>谢汉兰是一名华裔美国记者，同时也是一名为亚裔美国人和LGBT群体争取权益的活动家。谢女士毕业于普林斯顿大学伍德罗威尔逊公共和国际事务学院，是该校亚裔美国学生会的创始成员，也是该校第一届女毕业生的成员之一。1982年陈果仁被谋杀时谢汉兰刚好住在底特律，那时底特律地区还没有一个非常有组织的亚裔美国人运动，谢发表的新闻和宣传工作在对行凶者发起联邦民权指控时发挥了重要作用----在被判处州刑事犯罪后，此那个凶者并没有被关入狱中，并且只缴纳了3000元处罚金。这是美国历史上第一次在一起民权案件中由政府代表亚裔美国人的权益。谢的工作激起了亚裔美国人社区对这起犯罪事件的反应，标志着华人和其他亚裔首次团结起来，并与其他少数群体联盟，为亚裔美国人发声。谢对这起案件的介入是亚裔美国民权和仇恨犯罪立法的关键转折点。在她的职业生涯中，谢汉兰因其开创性的新闻报道而获奖，并一直是民权、妇女权利和LGBT权利的坚定倡导者。2008年，她允许记者报道她与相伴16年伴侣的婚礼，以显示“这个平等和人类尊严的根本问题也同样影响着我们的亚裔美国人社区。”</p>
