  <p>Wayne Wang is a Chinese American film director, known best for his 1993 adaptation of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>.Wang was born Hong Kong in 1949 and named after his father’s favorite movie star, John Wayne. Wang’s parents sent him to the U.S. to prepare for medical school but he fell in love with the arts instead and studied film and television at California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. Wang’s early films often grappled with the experiences of the Chinese diaspora: in his debut film, <i>Chan is Missing</i>(1982), Wang explored the daily ins and outs of Chinatown, a depiction that contrasted Hollywood’s typical use of the neighborhood as a racially coded signifier of mystery and danger. His family comedy about a Chinese American mother and daughter relationship, <i>Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart</i>, solidified his reputation before he created his most well-known film, <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> (1993). Wang would go on to release several successful feature films over his career. With the release of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> last year, the first film since <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> to have a majority Asian cast, the trailblazing legacy of Wang remains more relevant than ever.</p>

  <p>王颖（Wayne Wang）是一位美籍华人电影导演，因1993年由《喜福会》（<i>The Joy Luck Club</i>）改编的电影而闻名。王颖1949年出生于香港，以他父亲最喜欢的电影明星John Wayne的名字命名。王颖的父母送他去美国上医学院，但他却爱上了艺术，在奥克兰的加州艺术学院(California College of Arts and Crafts)学习影视。王颖早期的电影常常与散居海外的华人的经历有关：在他的处女作《寻人》（<i>Chan is Missing</i> 1982），王先生探索了唐人街的日常生活，与好莱坞将唐人街作为神秘和危险的种族象征的典型做法形成了对比。他的家庭喜剧《点心》（<i>Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart</i>）讲述了一个美籍华人母亲和她的女儿之间的关系，这部剧在他创作出自己最出名的电影《喜福会》（<i>The Joy Luck Club</i> 1993）之前确定了他在电影界的地位。在他的职业生涯中，王先生后续又发行了几部成功的故事片。去年上映的《摘金奇缘》（<i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>）是继《喜福会》之后的第一部亚裔演员占多数的电影，在这一点上，王颖留给后人的，是迄今为止最为重要的。</p>
