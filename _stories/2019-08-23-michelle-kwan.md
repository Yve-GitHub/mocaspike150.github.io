  <p>Michelle Kwan is a retired American figure skater. She has won a total of 43 championships from a combination of national, international, and Olympic competitions making her the most decorated U.S. figure skater in history. She was born in Torrance, California in 1980 to immigrant parents from Hong Kong and grew up speaking Cantonese and English. Watching her older sister Karen figure skate and her brother Ron play ice hockey inspired her take to the ice as well.</p>
  <p>At the age of 13, Kwan won the World Junior Figure Skating Championship. In 1998 she won the Silver medal at the Nagano, Japan Winter Olympics and a bronze medal at the subsequent 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. The rest of her skating career was marred by injuries and she has not competed in another Olympics. As a result she decided to broaden her talents by attending Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and International Diplomacy, where she received a graduate degree in International Relations in 2011. Her off-the-ice accomplishments include supporting Hillary Clinton’s Presidential Campaign as an outreach coordinator in 2016 and served under President Obama as a council member on the Council of Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, which strives to help Americans lead healthy, active lifestyles.</p>

  <p>关颖珊（Michelle Kwan）是一位退役的美国花样滑冰运动员。她在各项全国、国际和奥运会比赛中一共赢得了43个冠军，使她成为美国花样滑冰历史上获得奖牌最闪耀的明星。她于1980年出生在加州托伦斯，父母是香港移民，从小说着粤语和英语长大。看着姐姐Karen滑冰和哥哥Ron打冰球，以他们为榜样，她也开始喜欢上了冰上运动。</p>
  <p>在13岁那年，关颖珊就赢得了世界少年花样滑冰锦标赛冠军。1998年，她在日本长野冬奥会上获得银牌，又在随后的2002年犹他州盐湖城冬奥会上获得铜牌。在她滑冰生涯的剩余时间里，她一直受到伤病的困扰，再也没有参加过奥运会。因此，她决定进入塔夫茨大学弗莱彻法律与国际外交学院（Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and International Diplomacy）深造以拓宽自己的才能，并2011年在那里获得了国际关系硕士学位。她在冰场以外的成就包括2016年担任支持希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）总统大选的外联协调员，并在奥巴马总统手下担任健康、运动和营养委员会（Council of Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition）的委员。该委员会致力于帮助美国人养成健康、积极的生活方式。</p>
