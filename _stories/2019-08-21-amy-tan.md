  <p>Amy Tan is a Chinese American writer, best known for her debut novel “The Joy Luck Club.” Tan was born in Oakland, California in 1952 to Chinese immigrant parents; she was the second of three children. At the age of 15, both her father and brother died of brain tumors. This prompted her mother, Daisy, to move the rest of the family to Switzerland. Tan would begin to learn about her mother’s life in China and her three half-sisters. These stories became the basis for “The Joy Luck Club.”</p>
  <p>Tan’s novels often focus on exploring the relationships of mothers and daughters. While her work is generally well liked, some critics have criticized her for her depictions of Chinese culture and the stereotypical nature of her characters. Tan continues to write and can sometimes be found doing vocals for the rock band “Rock Bottom Remainders,” which consists of published writers; with some notable members being Stephen King and Matt Groening.</p>
