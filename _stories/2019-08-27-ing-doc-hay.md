  <p>Ing Hay (1862-1952), better known as “Doc Hay,” was a Chinese medical practitioner famed in pioneer era Oregon for his knowledge of Eastern medicine. Ing immigrated to the U.S. with his father in 1883, a year after the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act, and settled in John Day, Oregon. There he met fellow Chinese immigrant Lung On, who became his lifelong friend and business partner. Together they opened the Kam Wah Chung & Company general store, a social hub for the Chinese American community of John Day. Lung sold imported Chinese goods and other merchandise and Ing practiced traditional Chinese medicine, including herbalism and pulsology.</p>
  <p>While Ing’s initial patients were mostly Chinese, after clearing up an influenza outbreak in a nearby highway construction crew, he cemented his reputation in the non-Chinese community and patients of all ethnicities traveled from as far as Alaska and Oklahoma to receive treatments for illnesses that baffled other doctors. Ing diagnosed and treated a wide range of ailments – from polio to typhoid fever to infertility – with prescriptions including as many as 60 herbs purchased from San Francisco or Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>Jealous non-Chinese doctors accused Ing three times of practicing medicine without a license, but the charges were always dismissed. Ing was a pillar of the community, not only as a doctor but as a senior leader and generous caretaker – Ing took patients until losing his eyesight in 1948 and upon his death, $23,000 in uncashed patients’ checks were discovered in his quarters. Today, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department maintains the apothecary, now the Kam Wah Chung Heritage Site. In 2018, MOCA mounted an immersive exhibition entitled “On the Shelves of Kam Wah Chung” including medicines, photographs, and patient records from Ing’s apothecary.</p>

  <p>伍于念（Ing Hay 1862-1952），更广为人知的名字是“喜 医生”，是在俄勒冈拓荒时代以其东方医学知识而闻名的一名中医。1883年，《排华法案》通过一年后，伍于念随父亲移民美国，并在俄勒冈州的约翰日定居。在那里，他遇见了同样来自中国的移民梁光荣（Lung On），梁光荣后来成为了他一生的朋友和商业伙伴。他们一起开了金华昌公司（Kam Wah Chung & Company）综合商店，这里同时也是约翰日的华裔美国人社区的社交中心。梁光荣负责销售进口的中国货物和其他商品，伍于念则负责传统中医治疗，包括草药学和脉象学。</p>
  <p>尽管喜医生最初的病人大多是中国人，但在他清除了一场爆发在附近高速公路施工人员群体中的流感疫情后，喜医生巩固了自己在非华裔社区的声誉，各种族裔的病人从阿拉斯加和俄克拉荷马州远道赶来，接受一些难倒其他医生的疑难杂症的治疗。喜医生诊断并治疗了从小儿麻痹症到伤寒再到不孕不育等一系列疾病，处方中包括多达60种从旧金山或香港购买的草药。</p>
  <p>心怀嫉妒的非华裔医生三次指控喜医生无证行医，但这些指控总是被驳回。喜医生是社区的支柱，他不仅是一名医生，更是一位资深领导者和慷慨的看护人——喜医生一直照顾病人，直到他1948年失明。他去世后，在他的住所里发现了2.3万美元未兑现的病人支票。今天，Oregon Parks and Recreation Department维护着这间药房，现在叫金华昌文化保护遗址（Kam Wah Chung Heritage Site）。2018年，MOCA举办了一场名为“在金华昌公司的货架上”（On the Shelves of Kam Wah Chung）的沉浸式展览，展出了包括来自喜医生药房的药品、照片和病人记录。</p>
