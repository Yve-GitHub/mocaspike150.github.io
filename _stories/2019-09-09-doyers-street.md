  <p>Doyers Street, a one block stretch with a sharp bend in the middle, is one of the most historically rich streets in New York City’s Chinatown. Doyers Street was named for 18th-century Dutch immigrant Hendrik Doyer, who owned a distillery and tavern in 1791 where the street meets Bowery. It later became part of the very core of Chinatown, acting as the site for the first Chinese language theater in New York City from 1893-1911. In the early 1900s, the street earned the nickname “the Bloody Angle,” as warring tongs would hide behind the sharp bend of the street to attack their opponents as they turned the corner. In 1905, a particularly infamous and bloody attack occurred when the Hip Sing Tong targeted On Leong Tong members taking in an opera at the street’s theater. In the middle of the show, a Hip Sing Tong threw a string of lit firecrackers onto the stage before four more gunmen opened fire into the crowd of four hundred people. Four On Leong Tong died, as well as two civilians. But such violence waned over the years. Today, Doyers is a peaceful pedestrian only street and more famous as the home of Nam Wah Tea Parlor, which has been serving baked goods and more recently dim sum since 1920. It has also served as a filming location for Justin Timberlake’s “Take Back the Night” music video, and more recently the film John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum.</p>

  <p>宰也街（Doyers Street）是一个街区中间有一道急弯的街道，是纽约唐人街历史最悠久的街道之一。宰也街是以18世纪荷兰移民Hendrik Doyer的名字命名的。1791年，他在宰也街与包厘街交汇的地方拥有一家酿酒厂和酒馆。后来，宰也街成为唐人街非常核心的部分，从1893年到1911年，它是纽约市第一家中文剧院的所在地。在20世纪初，这条街获得了“血角”（the Bloody Angle）的绰号，因为当时交战的堂会会躲在街道的急弯后面，在对手转弯时攻击他们。1905年，一场尤其臭名昭著的血腥袭击发生了。当时协胜堂袭击了在街头剧院里看演出的安良堂成员。演出进行到一半时，一名协胜堂成员将一串点燃的鞭炮扔上舞台，随后又有四名枪手向四百名观众开枪，造成四名安良堂成员和两名平民死亡。但这些暴力事件随着时间的流逝减少了。如今的宰也街是一条宁静的步行街，更出名的是南华茶室（Nam Wah Tea Parlor）就位于此处。自1920年来，南华茶室一直供应烘焙食品，最近又推出广东茶点。它还曾是贾斯汀·汀布莱克（Justin Timberlake）的《重返黑夜》（Take Back the Night）的mv的拍摄地，最近还在那里怕设立拍摄了电影《捍卫任务3：全面开战》（John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum）。</p>
