  <p>Jackie Chan is a Hong Kong martial artist, actor, singer, stuntman, and international pop culture phenomenon. Since the 1960s, Chan has appeared in over 150 films and is one of the most recognizable stars in the world. Born Chan Kong-sang in 1954, Chan earned the childhood nickname of “Pao-pao” (cannonball) for his energetic antics. He began appearing in films at five years old, and by 17 he was working as a stuntman for Bruce Lee’s Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon. Chan has said that he created his on-screen persona, from personality to martial arts style, to contrast Lee’s. Chan cemented his place in the action comedy genre in the 1980s, becoming a Hollywood superstar with his first blockbuster success, Rush Hour (1998). </p>
  <p>In 2003, Chan founded his own film production company in order to have more control over his roles and the filmmaking process. Over the span of his film career, Chan has experimented with drama and villain roles alongside his classic action comedy roles. Chan’s stardom is literally cemented on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and all over global popular culture. In 2000, MOCA honored Jackie Chan at its Annual Legacy Awards Gala.</p>

  <p>成龙（Jackie Chan）是香港武术家、演员、歌手、特技演员，他还引发了一种国际流行文化现象。自20世纪60年代以来，成龙出演了150多部电影，是世界上最知名的明星之一。成龙1954年出生，原名陈港生（Chan Kong-sang），童年时因其充满活力的滑稽动作而获得了“炮炮”（炮弹）的昵称。他5岁时开始参演电影，17岁在李小龙的《精武门》（Fist of Fury）和《龙争虎斗》（Enter the Dragon）中作特技替身演员。成龙说，他创造了自己的银幕形象，从个性到武术风格，与李小龙形成对比。成龙在20世纪80年代巩固了自己在动作喜剧领域的地位，1998年凭借首部大片《尖峰时刻》（Rush Hour 1998）的成功成为好莱坞巨星。</p>
  <p>2003年，成龙成立了自己的电影制作公司，以便更好地控制自己的角色和电影制作过程。在成龙的电影生涯中，除了经典的动作喜剧角色，他还尝试过戏剧和反派角色。成龙的明星地位在好莱坞星光大道、香港星光大道以及全球流行文化中得到了巩固。2000年，MOCA在其年度传承大奖颁奖晚会上颁奖给成龙。</p>
