  <p>A number of top-notch Asian American performers would start their careers at Forbidden City, including the inimitable Jadin Wong. She was born in 1913 and began dancing at age five and ran away from home at 17 to pursue her dream. She began headlining as a dancer at the Forbidden City in 1938. Her brassy wit, showgirl glam, and sensational dancing would make her a national sensation, landing her a feature in <i>Life</i> magazine and inspire the role of Madame Liang in <i>Flower Drum Song</i>.</p>
  <p>Jadin performed for the troops during World War II; even jumping out of a plane going down in German territory and sneaking through the Black Forest to make her evening performance with Bob Hope for one performance. At the <i>China Doll</i> nightclub in New York City she was the first female Asian American performer in New York. She would eventually transition to comedy and Asian talent management. An unstoppable firecracker of a personality, Jadin Wong not only defied stereotypes to pave the way for Asian entertainers but actively dedicated the rest of her career to supporting emerging Asian talent until her passing in March 2010 at the age of 96.</p>

  <p>许多顶尖的亚裔美国演员都是在“紫禁城夜总会”开启他们的职业生涯的，包括独一无二的Jadin Wong。她出生于1913年，5岁开始跳舞，17岁离开家去追求自己的梦想。1938年，她开始以舞蹈演员的身份成为“紫禁城”的门面。她大胆的智慧，女性的魅力，和精妙的舞技使得她成为了轰动全国的人物，登上了《生活》杂志的特写版面，并启发了音乐电影《花鼓戏》中Madame Liang这一角色。</p>
  <p>Jadin在二战期间为军队表演，甚至从一架飞机上跳下来，进入德国境内，并偷偷穿过黑森林，和鲍勃·霍普为军队进行了一场夜场演出。在纽约的中国娃娃夜总会，她成为了第一位在纽约演出的亚裔美国女性。最后，她转型到了喜剧和亚裔演员经纪管理领域。作为一个个性十足、势不可挡的爆破性人物，Jadin Wong不仅打破陈规，为亚洲艺人表演铺平了道路，而且她一直积极投身于支持亚洲新兴人才的事业，直到她在2010年3月以96岁高龄与世长辞。</p>
