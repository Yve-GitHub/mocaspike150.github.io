  <p>While the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first law to bar an immigrant group solely on the basis of nationality, related acts passed over the next several decades served to tighten exclusionary laws against Chinese. The Alien Registration Act of 1940, popularly known as the Smith Act, required that all resident aliens in the U.S. be registered and fingerprinted and that they carry their card with them at all times. The Smith Act was enacted in response to the growing fears of fascism and communism, as well as the labor movement being led by the immigrant workers. But registration cards like this harken back to the Geary Act of 1892, which not only renewed the Chinese Exclusion Act but required Chinese to carry documentation at all times. This alien registration card belonged to On Chin – the front of his card bears his name and address while the back bears his signature and right index fingerprint.</p>

  <p>1882年的《排华法案》是第一部仅以国籍为由禁止移民群体的法律，而在接下来的几十年里，又通过了一些相关的法案，加强了针对华人的排华法律。1940年的《外国人登记法》（Alien Registration Act），即广为人知的《史密斯法》（Smith Act），要求所有在美国居住的外国人都必须登记并采集指纹，而且他们必须随身携带这张登记证。史密斯法案的颁布是为了回应对日益增长的法西斯主义和共产主义的恐惧，同时也有对由移民工人领导的劳工运动的担忧。但像这样的登记卡可以追溯到1892年的《基瑞法案》（Geary Act），该法案不仅更新了《排华法案》，而且还要求中国人随身携带文件。这是On Chin的外国人登记卡——卡的正面写着他的姓名和地址，背面有他的签名和右手食指指纹。</p>
