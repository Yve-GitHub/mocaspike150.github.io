  <p>Bridge: the Magazine of Asians in America was a landmark Asian American publication. Historically, the mainstream American press had spoken for the white majority, either ignoring the experiences of Asian Americans and other people of color or covering their neighborhoods and members disparagingly. On the other hand, the ethnically Asian press were often propagandistic and touted the accomplishments of singular ethnic groups rather than drawing from unified experiences and issues across ethnic lines. Bridge was born from the Asian American Movement’s need for an alternative Asian American press that could speak to a diverse array of perspectives and social issues and mobilize its readers. Its name expressed its mission to not only bridge Asian America with white America, but to bridge experiences between Asian American groups. The Basement Workshop published its first issue of Bridge in 1971 and would continually evolve the publication’s initial focus towards China and overseas Chinese to its iconic blend of Asian American national political issues, criticism, art, poetry, and fiction. In 1979, Bridge ceased its affiliation with Basement Workshop and ultimately ended in 1985. Bridge would prove to be one of only three Asian American publications of the era with far-reaching readership, influence, and staying power.</p>

  <p>《桥：亚裔美国人的杂志》是一部具有里程碑意义的亚裔美国刊物。从历史上看，主流美国媒体一直为作为大多数的白人发声，他们无视亚裔美国人和其他有色人种的经历，或者以轻蔑的论调报道他们的社区和成员。另一方面，亚裔各族新闻界经常宣传和吹捧单一民族的成就，而不是提取跨族界的共同经验和问题来报道。</p>
  <p>亚裔美国运动对亚裔美国媒体提出了新的需求，要求能够涉猎各种各样的观点和社会问题，并能够调动它的读者。在这样的要求下，《桥》杂志诞生了。它的名字表达了他的使命不仅是将亚裔美国人和美国白人联系起来，而且要在亚裔美国各群体之间分享经验。地下室工作坊于1971年出版了《桥》杂志第一期 ，并继续将该刊物的创办初衷延伸到中国和海外华人，发展它将亚裔美国人的国家政治问题、批评、艺术、诗歌和小说相混合的标志性特色。在1979年，《桥》杂志停止了与地下室工作坊的合作，最终于1985年停刊。《桥》被证明是那个年代仅有的三份具有广泛读者、影响力和持久力的亚裔美国出版物之一。</p>
