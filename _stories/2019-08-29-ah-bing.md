  <p>Ah Bing was a 19th century horticulturalist and credited as the cultivator and namesake of the popular Bing cherry. Bing migrated to the U.S. around 1855 and worked as foreman in the Lewelling family fruit orchards in Milwaukie, Oregon. Bing’s Manchurian background and commanding stature at 6’2” distinguished him from other Chinese immigrants, who were mostly recruited from Guangdong for work on the Transcontinental Railroad; his employer was atypical too, a pro-abolition Quaker farmer who opposed the increasing anti-Chinese discrimination and violence of the times. During Bing’s 35 years as a foreman at the Lewelling Orchard, he managed a crew of thirty men and worked closely with farm owner Seth Lewelling on grafting and propagating the trees. In 1875, Bing was credited (to varying degrees) with cultivating a delicious cross-breed graft, which Lewelling named after Bing. The groundbreaking cherry went on to win prizes and sell for $1 per pound ($25 per pound today). Still, Bing’s contribution to American agriculture could not overcome the passing of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. After visiting his family in China in 1889, Bing was barred from ever re-entering the U.S.</p>

  <p>阿冰（Ah Bing）是19世纪的园艺师，也是广受欢迎的冰樱 （Bing cherry）的培育者和冰樱名字的由来。阿冰在1855年左右移居美国，在俄勒冈州密尔沃基的Lewelling家族果园当工头。阿冰的满族背景和身高6英尺2英寸（约1.83米）的威风凛凛的身高使他有别于其他的中国移民，那些移民大多来自广东，在横贯大陆铁路工程工作；他的雇主在当时是非典型的，是一位支持废除偏见的农场主，他反对那个时代日益增长的反华歧视和暴力行为。阿冰在莱维灵（Lewelling）果园当了35年工头，他管理着30名工人，并在树木嫁接繁殖方面与农场主斯莱维灵（Seth Lewelling）密切合作。1875年，阿冰因培育出一种美味的杂交樱桃而受到（不同程度上的）赞誉，莱维灵将此成果以阿冰的名字命名。这种开创性的樱桃后来赢得了大奖，售价为每磅1美元（今天是每磅25美元）。尽管如此，阿冰对美国农业的贡献还是无法克服1882年通过的排华法案。1889年，阿冰回中国探亲后，被禁止再次进入美国。</p>
