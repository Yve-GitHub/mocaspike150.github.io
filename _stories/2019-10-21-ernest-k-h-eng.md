  <p>Ernest K.H. Eng was born in Norfolk, VA in 1920. During World War II he was drafted into the army; he decided to go to officer candidate school in 1943. He successfully completed the course and achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel when he retired in 1963. Throughout his military career he served as aide-de-camp to serval higher ranking officers.</p>
  <p>Gen. George C. Marshall led a mission to China shortly after the end of World War II in December of 1945. During this trip Eng served as his aide-de-camp. The mission was organized by the US army to negotiate between the communists and nationalists to unify the Chinese government. The mission lasted about a year but failed to reach any common ground. In January of 1947, the envoy, frustrated with the failed negotiations, left China.</p>
  <p>After the mission Eng remained in the army until his retirement in 1963. He would move his family to Atlanta, Georgia in 1974, where he would remain a resident until his death in June 2010.</p>
