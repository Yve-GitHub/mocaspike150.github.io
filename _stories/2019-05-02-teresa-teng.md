  <p>Today our new music exhibition “The Moon Represents My Heart: Music, Memory & Belonging” opens. In honor of our new show, we will be featuring music related artifacts for the entire month!</p>
  <p>Teresa Teng was a Taiwanese pop singer, who is considered to be one of the most famous and successful mandarin language singers in the world. Her song “The Moon Represents my Heart” was used as the inspiration for MOCA’s music exhibition that opens today. While Teng passed away in 1995 at the age of 42 due to a severe respiratory attack, her music continues to endure.</p>
  <p>In 1996 the movie “Tian Mi Mi” (<i>Comrades: Almost a Love Story</i>) was released. The film is titled after a Teng song of the same name and tells the story of the forlorn love between two Chinese mainlanders that have a brief affair in Hong Kong but end up falling in love. Throughout the film Teng’s song are prominently featured and coming out just a year after the singers death was seen as a fitting tribute to her.</p>
