  <p>The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck was published in 1931; her second novel. The novel depicts
  the life of a family living in a rural Chinese village in the early 20 th century. In 1938 Buck would
  win a Nobel Prize in Literature “for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China
  and for her biographical masterpieces.”The Good Earth would be adapted for Broadway in 1932
  and that version was adapted for film in 1937. Originally the Chinese American actress Anna
  May Wong was supposed to play the leading role O-Lan but she was replaced by Austrian
  American Actress Luise Rainer. Buck had hoped to cast all Chinese actors but the producers
  didn’t think that the prospect would appeal to American audiences. As a result all the major
  roles were given to western actors in yellow face while Chinese American actors were cast in
  some supporting roles. The movie was nominated for 5 academy awards with Luise Rainer
  winning for best actress.

  <p>赛珍珠的小说《大地》出版于1931年，这是她的第二部小说。小说描写了二十世纪早期
  中国乡村的家庭生活。1938年赛珍珠“因为丰富而真实地描述了中国农民生活，同
  时也是一部自传体的杰作”而获得诺贝尔文学奖。《大地》于1932年被改编成百老
  汇剧，1937年又在此基础上被改编成电影。最初设想由华裔女演员黄柳霜出演主
  角“阿兰”，结果被奥地利美国女演员Luise Rainer 所取代。赛珍珠曾希望全剧由中国
  演员出演，但制片人认为前景并不乐观，这样做不能取悦美国观众。最后所有黄皮
  肤的主要角色都有西方演员出演，而华裔演员只演了一些跑龙套的角色。这部电影
  获得五个学院奖提名，Luise Rainer获得最佳女演员奖。
