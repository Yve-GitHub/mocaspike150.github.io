  <p>Mooie Eng was born in 1916 in Guangdong, China. She would immigrate to the US and attend college at Ohio State; graduating in 1941. She then became the first Chinese RN to work for the Community Service Society (CSS), a private agency in New York City staffed by social workers and public health nurses. CSS was founded in 1843 to tackle issues of systemic poverty in the City of New York. During her tenure at CSS, Eng helped create access to vital health services within the Chinese American community. She was instrumental in assisting many “war brides” from World War II that were hindered by the language barrier and an unfamiliar health system. In the 1960s, she helped found the Chinatown Planning Council (CPC), which is still active today under then name Chinese American Planning Council. She passed away in January of 2016.</p>
