  <p>The Third Avenue El was an elevated railway line that ran from Manhattan to the Bronx. It was opened in 1887 and originally owned by a private railway company but would eventually be acquired by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). The tracks covered the entire length of Bowery, including a portion in Chinatown with a stations at Canal Street and Chatham Square. While the El heralded an age of technological advancement, the soot and shadows cast by the elevated tracks contributed to the Bowery and the surrounding neighborhood’s descent into a disreputable “skid row.” The line remained in operation through in the Bronx through 1973 but the Manhattan portion was closed in 1955.</p>

  <p>第三大道高架铁路线是一条从曼哈顿到布朗克斯的高架铁路线。它于1887年投入使用，最初由一家私营铁路公司所有，但最终被大都会运输署（MTA）收购。铁轨覆盖了整条包厘街，包括唐人街的一部分，在坚尼街和且林士果广场设有车站。虽然高架铁路预示着一个技术进步的时代，但是高架轨道产生的煤烟和投下的阴影却导致包厘和周边社区沦落成了臭名昭著的“贫民窟”。这条线路在布朗克斯一直运营到1973年，但曼哈顿部分在1955年就关闭了。</p>
