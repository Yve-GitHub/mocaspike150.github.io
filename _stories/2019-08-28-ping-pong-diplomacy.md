  <p>Ping pong was invented in England in the 1880s, but its association with Chinese athletics is undeniable. In the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung instituted it as a recreational activity for the People’s Liberation Army, after which it quickly became China’s most popular sport. The game played a crucial role in the thawing of relations between China and the U.S. in 1971 when a U.S. ping pong player, Glenn Cowan, accidentally boarded a Chinese team bus at the World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan. Cowan was greeted by Zhuang Zedong of the Chinese team and the two had a conversation via translator. After learning of this exchange, Chairman Mao invited the U.S. team to visit tour China; President Nixon approved the trip, ending an over 20 year period of diplomatic silence between the two nations.</p>
  <p>In February of the following year, President Nixon would visit China and meet with Chairman Mao and begin normalizing U.S.-China relations. April of that same year a Chinese delegation of ping pong players would tour America for two weeks; this exchange become known as “ping pong diplomacy.” On April 28th , 1972 the Chinese team would play an exhibition game at Stanford University’s Maples Pavilion.</p>

  <p>乒乓球于19世纪80年代起源于英国，但它与中国体育的联系是不可否认的。在1920年代，毛泽东决定将其作为中国人民解放军的娱乐活动，之后迅速成为中国最受欢迎的运动。1971年，在日本名古屋举办的世界兵乓球锦标赛，因为美国乒乓球运动员格伦·考恩（Glenn Cowan）意外登上了一辆中国队的大巴，在中美关系解冻过程中发挥了至关重要作用。考恩受到了中国队庄则栋的欢迎，两人通过翻译进行了对话。在得知这次交流以后，毛主席邀请了美国乒乓球队访华，尼克松总统批准了这次访问，结束了两国20多年来的外交沉默。</p>
  <p>第二年2月，尼克松总统访问中国，并会见了毛主席，开始了中美关系正常化进程。同年4月，中国乒乓球代表团在美国进行了为期两周的访问；这种交流被称为“乒乓外交”。1972年4月28日，中国乒乓球队在斯坦福大学的枫树馆（Maples Pavilion）进行了一场表演赛。</p>
