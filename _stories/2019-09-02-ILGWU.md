  <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) was once one of the largest labor unions in the United States. Founded in 1900 by local union delegates, it represented about 2,000 members in cities in the Northeastern United States. The union grew in geographical scope, membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.</p>
  <p>Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). In 2004 UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) to form UNITE HERE, which today serves over 300,000 members in the United States and Canada.</p>
  <p>On June 24, 1982, nearly 20,000 Chinatown garment workers belonging to the ILGWU went on the largest strike in the history of New York’s Chinatown. Contractors employing the women had rejected the newest contract negotiated by the ILGWU, attempting to undercut rules regarding holiday and overtime pay as well as non-union manufacturing. Rallying in Columbus Park, the demonstration was unlike anything the neighborhood had ever seen, with thousands and thousands of Chinese immigrant women rallying together as one. Within a few days, all but a handful of Chinatown contractors pledge to sign the union contact; the union organized a second rally on June 29 as large as the first one with threats to strike against any contractor that did not sign. It only took hours for all contractors to pledge, ending in victory.</p>

  <p>国际女服车衣工会（The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union），简称ILGWU，曾是美国最大的工会之一。该组织由当地工会代表于1900年成立，代表了美国东北部城市的约2000名会员。到本世纪中叶，该工会在地域范围、成员规模和政治影响力上不断壮大，成为美国劳工组织中最强大的力量之一。</p>
  <p>ILGWU代表妇女服装行业的工人，通过集体谈判协议、培训项目、卫生保健设施、共有住房、教育机会和其他等努力改善其成员的工作和生活条件。1995年，ILGWU与美国合并服装工会（Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union）合并，成立了针线业、工业和纺织业雇员联盟（Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees），简称UNITE。2004年，UNITE与旅馆饭店工会（Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union）简称HERE合并，成立了UNITE HERE，现在为美国和加拿大的30多万名会员提供服务。</p>
  <p>1982年6月24日，近2万名隶属于ILGWU的唐人街制衣工举行了纽约唐人街历史上规模最大的罢工。雇佣这些妇女的承包商拒绝了ILGWU谈判达成的最新合同，试图削减有关假期、加班费以及非工会制造的规定。这次在哥伦布公园举行的集会是这个社区从未见过的，成千上万的中国女性移民团结在一起。几天之内，除了少数唐人街的承包商外，几乎所有承包商都承诺签署工会合同；6月29日，工会再次组织了与第一次同样规模的集会，声称将以罢工反对那些没有签字的承包商。这次只用了几个小时，所有承包商都做出了承诺，工人们最终取得了胜利。</p>
