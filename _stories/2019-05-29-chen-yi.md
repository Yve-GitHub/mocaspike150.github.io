  <p>Chen Yi is a violinist and classical music composer, who was born in Guangzhou, China in 1953. She began studying piano at the age of 3 but her musical education was derailed by the Cultural Revolution. During that time she was sent to perform mandatory labor in the countryside; she used this time to learn and appreciate Chinese folk culture. After the Cultural Revolution, Yi became the first Chinese woman to receive a Master of Arts in music composition from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing in 1986. She continues to compose and blend eastern and western sensibilities in her compositions.</p>
