  <p>Keye Luke (1904-1991) was a Chinese American artist, actor, and founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. One of the most prominent Asian actor’s in America in the mid-twentieth century, he was the first Chinese-American contract actor signed by RKO, Universal Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He was first an artist and muralist, beginning in the studio system as a commercial set artist before landing his first acting role in <i>The Painted Veil</i> alongside Greta Garbo. Luke’s acting career took off when he was cast as Charlie Chan’s eldest son in <i>Charlie Chan in Paris</i> – his incredible on-screen rapport with lead actor Warner Oland turned “Number One Son” into a regular character in the series. Luke went on to have a prolific career in Hollywood. He became the only Asian actor to play an Asian lead detective in the 1930s and 1940s with the role of Mr. Wong in <i>Phantom of Chinatown</i>, which he portrayed without “Orientalizing” the character as his predecessor Boris Karloff had done. Luke also played Kato in the original <i>Green Hornet</i> serials and appeared in a number of popular TV shows, including <i>Kung Fu</i>, <i>General Hospital</i>, and <i>Star Trek</i>. Luke was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990.</p>
