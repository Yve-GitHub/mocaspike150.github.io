  <p>Port Arthur Restaurant was opened in 1897 by Chu Gam Fai. It was named after a port city in Northern China now called the Lüshunkou District. It was the first restaurant to receive a liquor license in Chinatown and remained in operation for over 80 years at the same location on the second and third floor at 7-9 Mott Street.</p>
  <p>The restaurant was known for its authentic Chinese décor, featuring inlaid pearl mahogany tables, lanterns, chandeliers, and imported Cantonese teakwood furniture. The restaurant used the second floor as a general dining area and reserved the third floor for hosting private parties, banquets, ceremonial dinners, and weddings.</p>
