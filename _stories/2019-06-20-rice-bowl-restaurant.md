  <p>The Rice Bowl Restaurant was located at 44 Mott Street in New York City’s Chinatown. It was opened by Chin Suey Bing in 1939 and at the time was considered one of the fanciest restaurants in Chinatown. It was also one of the first banquet halls in the neighborhood to have air conditioning and required all male diners to wear jackets and ties. The restaurant closed in 1970.</p>
  <p>Artifacts from the Rice Bowl can be found in the Marcella Chin Dear Collection, whose namesake is the daughter of Chin Suey Bing. The Marcella Chin Dear Collection remains MOCA’s largest family collection to date.</p>
