  <p>The Chinese Tuxedo restaurant opened in 1897 at 2 Doyers Street in New York’s Chinatown. It opened at a time when serval other upscale Chinese restaurants were also popping up, all attempting to take advantage of the influx of non-Chinese tourism to Chinatown. The restaurant was decorated with elaborate chandeliers and tables with decorative patterns, chosen to appeal to visitors looking for an “exotic” experience. The restaurant was best known for its ornate eagle crowned balcony, which served as advertising that could be seen from the now defunct Third Avenue El train. The restaurant closed sometime in the mid- 1900s.</p>

  <p>1897年，探花楼酒家在纽约唐人街宰也街2号开业了。它开业之时，另外几家高档中餐厅也如雨后春笋般涌现，那时非华人游客开始涌入唐人街，它们都试图抓住这个机会。餐厅装饰着精致的枝形吊灯，餐桌上刻画着精美的图案，以吸引寻求“异国情调”体验的游客。这家餐厅最著名的是其华丽的鹰冠阳台，简直就是它招牌式的广告，从现已停摆的第三大道高架铁路列车上还可以看到。这家餐厅在90年代中期的时候关闭了。</p>
