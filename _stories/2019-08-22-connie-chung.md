  <p>Connie Chung is an American journalist who became the first Asian and the second woman to co-anchor a major network’s national news weekday broadcast when she became co-anchor of the CBS evening news in 1993. Chung studied journalism at the University of Maryland and received her BA in 1969. Just two year after that she was hired by CBS News to be their Washington D.C. correspondent. It was in this position that she landed her first big interview with President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. By 1989, Chung was one of the most popular journalists in television and moved to CBS where she hosted her own evening news shows before being tapped to co-anchor the CBS evening news. She was let go from the show in 1995 but continued her journalistic career at other networks. Chung has not officially retired. Most recently in 2018, she made a guest appearance as herself in the sitcom “Fresh off the Boat.”</p>
