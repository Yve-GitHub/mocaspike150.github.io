  <p>Chan was married three times, bearing one child with his first wife and one child with his second wife. He was married to his third wife, the aunt of the collection’s donor, for forty-two years. In the collection are a series of letters from his second wife, King-Fong.   In her letters, she speaks sorrowfully of their separation across Hong Kong and Washington D.C. and tells him about the things their baby daughter has been doing, such as starting to eat rice. Fang also wrote a short autobiography, describing how she and Chan fell for each other, fled to Hong Kong to marry when the Japanese conquered Guangzhou, and began the process of bringing Fang and their children to the U.S. until the bombing of the Kai Tak Airport of hong kong dashed her dreams of reuniting with her husband.</p>
