  <p>When Japan invaded Guangzhou in 1938, many Chinese parents living in the United States began to worry for the children they left at home. This fear of Japanese aggression resulted in an influx of Chinese youth to many cities across the United States by the late 1930’s. Empowered by China’s now-unified front against Japan, Chinese youths had the freedom in the United States to protest the Japanese invasion—and did so through creating Chinese Youth National Salvation Club, which also became known as the Chinese Youth Club (CYC).</p>
  <p>The youth organization supported the Chinese war effort against Japan through lectures, photography exhibitions, film screening, and various performances. The CYC even branched out into more mainstream American political movements, like the May First Labor Day Parades, New York City boycotts of Japanese silk, and protests at the Brooklyn waterfront over the shipment of scrap metal to Japan. Its heyday continued into the U.S. and China’s alliance, but once American presidents started suspecting Chinese clubs for communist activity during the Cold War, membership to centers like the Chinese Youth Club became dangerous and declined.</p>

  <p>当1938年日本入侵广州时，许多住在美国的中国父母开始担心他们留在家里的孩子。这种对日本侵略的恐惧导致了中国青年在20世纪30年代末涌入美国的许多城市。在中国当时的抗日统一战线的支持下，中国青年在美国抗议日本侵略，并为此创建了华侨青年救国团（Chinese Youth National Salvation Club），也被称作（Chinese Youth Club，简称CYC）。</p>
  <p>这个青年组织通过讲座、摄影展、电影放映和各种演出来支持中国抗日战争。CYC甚至将活动扩展到了更主流的美国政治运动中，比如五一劳动节游行、纽约市对日本丝绸的抵制行动和在布鲁克林海滨对向日本运输废金属的抗议。它的全盛时期一直延续到美国和中国结成联盟。但自从在冷战期间，美国总统开始怀疑中国社团会进行共产主义活动，像CYC这样的会员制团体就开始变得危险和不被接受。</p>
