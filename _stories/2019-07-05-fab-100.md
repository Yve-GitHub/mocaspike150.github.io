  <p>In 1945, one hundred young Chinese officers were specially selected for a confidential mission and sent on planes to the U.S. with no knowledge of their assignment’s purpose. The “FAB-100” were well educated, fluent in English, familiar with American military doctrine, highly trained, and had seen heavy combat. They were divided into two groups containing 50 members each. Both groups left out of the city of Kunming in the Yunnan province only two months apart; the first leaving in April and the second in June. Their voyage to the U.S. – which passed through, Burma, India, Saudi Arabia, Cairo, Libya, Casablanca, the Azores, and Newfoundland – was so secretive that they made no refueling stops to avoid the Axis agents’ eyes, flew through weather that would have grounded most aircraft, and arrived in New York without the U.S. generals there knowing they were coming. After the two groups of fifty arrived in New York and California, the highly skilled “Chinese Training Detachment” worked as interpreters and instructors in classrooms, labs, shops, and in the air, teaching aviation mechanics, bombardiers, meteorologists, navigators, pilots, and radio mechanics. While many of the FAB-100 were stationed at Bergstrom Army Air Field in Austin, TX, members of the special task force eventually served at most major air bases in the South, Midwest, and West. In December 1945, the FAB-100 were disbanded and 56 of the officers chose to stay in the U.S., many receiving advanced degrees. In 1945, President Truman awarded 22 of the officers with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their “meritorious service” to the U.S. against the enemy, although it took over forty years for many to receive their awards. To this day, the original secret mission of the FAB-100 remains unknown. The above photo shows the second half of FAB-100 after they arrived in Bakersfield, CA.</p>

  <p>1945年，100名年轻的中国军官被特别挑选出来执行一项机密任务，在不知道任务目的的情况下被派上飞机前往美国，代号“FAB-100”。“FAB-100”成员均受过良好的教育，能讲流利的英语，熟悉美国的军事理论，训练有素并经历过激烈的战斗。他们被分成两组，每组50人，相隔两个月自云南省昆明市出发；第一组在4月份出发，第二组在6月份出发。他们到美国的航线途径缅甸、印度、沙特阿拉伯、开罗、利比亚、卡萨布兰卡、亚速尔群岛和纽芬兰，非常隐秘，他们没有停下来加油以避人耳目，他们在大多数飞机停飞的恶劣天气下飞行，在没有美国的将军知道他们要来的情况下抵达了纽约。在这两支50人的队伍分别抵达纽约和加州以后，这支技术高超的“中国训练分队”在教室、实验室、商店和航线中担任口译和指导，教授航空机械、轰炸机、气象学、导航、飞行和无线电技术等。尽管“FAB-100”的许多成员驻扎在得克萨斯州奥斯汀的Bergstrom美军空军基地，但这支特遣部队的成员最终在南部、中西部和西部的大多数主要空军基地服役。1945年12月，“FAB-100”被解散，56名军官选择留在美国，许多人获得了高等学位。1945年，杜鲁门总统授予22名军官总统自由勋章，以表彰他们为美国抗击敌人的立功表现，尽管他们中的许多人40多年时间后才收到这些勋章。直到今天，“FAB-100”最初的秘密任务仍然未知。上面的照片是“FAB-100”的第二组成员抵达加州贝克斯菲尔德后拍摄的。</p>
