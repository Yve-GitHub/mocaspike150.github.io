  <p><i>Paper Son: One Man’s Story</i> is the memoir of Tung Pok Chin, a “paper son” who immigrated to America with falsified documents alongside thousands of other Chinese during the era of the Chinese Exclusion Act. When Tung arrived in America, he worked and lived in hand laundries, dedicated himself to learning English, and eventually became an active member of key organizations in his community. He wrote poetry about his struggles living in America, which were regularly published in the <i>China Daily News</i>. But his work eventually brought him to the attention of the FBI who were keen on ferreting out communists and illegal immigrants. This memoir brings the historical era of Exclusion to life and personifies the fears and struggles that went along with being a “paper son,” speaking both to the specific and rarely published account of a “paper son” as well as to a more universal immigrant experience.</p>

  <p>《纸儿子：一个男人的故事》（<i>Paper Son: One Man’s Story</i>）是Tung Pok Chin的回忆录。Tung Pok Chin是一个“纸儿子”，在排华法案期间，他和其他成千上万的中国人一起，带着伪造的文件移民到美国。当他来到美国后，他在洗衣店工作和生活，致力于学习英语，并最终成为他所在社区的重要组织的积极成员。他写了关于他在美国生活中挣扎的诗，并定期发表在《美洲华侨日报》（<i>China Daily News</i>）上。但他的作品最终引起了联邦调查局的注意，他们一直热衷追查共产主义者和非法移民。这本回忆录将排华的历史时代展现在眼前，并将作为一个“纸儿子”所经历的恐惧和挣扎个人化，即讲述了一个具体的鲜为人知的“纸儿子”的故事，也讲述了一个更为普遍的移民经历。</p>
