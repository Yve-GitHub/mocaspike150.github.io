  <p>In 1945 after the end of World War II the United States passed the War Brides Act. This allowed returning US soldiers to bring back their alien spouse, and children from overseas as a non-quota immigrant. This act would remain in effect for 3 years and seeing more than 100,000 people enter the US under the act.</p>
  <p>In 1946, news agency <i>ACME Newspictures</i> published a photograph depicting a young former GI introducing his new wife, who was Chinese, to his parents. Frank H. Rathbone (22) and Wu Shih-San Rathbone (21) met and married the previous year when Frank was stationed with the U.S. Army in China. While Frank was “expecting the worse” when he brought Wu Shih-San to his parents’ home in Queens, NY, the accompanying story notes that the newlyweds were “pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome they accorded her.”</p>

  <p>1945年，二战结束后，美国通过了《战争新娘法》。这使得回国的美国士兵可以从海外带回他们的外籍配偶和子女，并不占用移民配额。该法案持续了3年，有超过10万人受益于该法案进入美国。</p>
  <p>1946年，新闻机构<i>ACME Newspictures</i>刊登了一张照片，照片中，一名年轻的复员美国士兵向他的父母介绍他的新婚中国妻子。Frank H. Rathbone（22岁）和Wu Shih-San Rathbone（21岁）是在前一年Frank跟随美国军队驻扎在中国时相识并结婚的。当Frank 把Wu Shih-San 带回他位于纽约皇后区的父母家时，Frank原本“做了最坏的打算”，但接下来的情况却使得这对新婚夫妇“对她所受到的热烈欢迎而感到惊喜。”</p>
