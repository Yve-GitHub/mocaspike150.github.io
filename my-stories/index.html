In 2019, Transcontinental Railroad turns 150.  Its construction extended the new era of large-scale Chinese immigration to America. Unbeknownst to these Chinese laborers who ventured to this far-off, foreign land, their contributions were key to the construction of this monumental railroad.</P> <!--more-->  

 <p>A century and a half saw the shift in the global social, political and economic landscape that forever redefined the Chinese American experience and resulted in the explosion of the Chinese population and socio-economic growth in America. </P>

<p>To name a few important moments and events in hisotry over the last 150 years, </p>
<ul>
  <li> The U.S. passed and repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act</li>
<li> WWI and WWII began and ended</li>
<li> Social turmoils following the regime changes from Qing Dynasty to the Republic to the People's Republic</li>
<li> The yo-yoing of the mercurial Sino-American relationship </li>
<li> The explosion in the Chinese American population from tens of thousands to tens of millions </li>
</ul>
<p>
Supposed the average human generation is roughly 25 years; this would give rise to six generations in 150 years.  It is truly remarkable that six generations of Chinese Americans have weathered, survived, excelled and grew on the American soil, which was at times antagonistic and toxic, filled with discrimination and inequality. </p>

<p>History is an account of humankind and humanity is a collection of countless stories of men and women.  Regardless of the era, Chinese in America are connected by a treasure chest full of stories.  Yet, the rightful claim to uncover, narrate and record the Chinese history in America should fall on shoulder and hands of each Chinese American and our children.  </p>

<p>Founded in 1980, Museum of Chinese in America, MOCA, invites Chinese Americans to open your heart, pick up a pen (or open a computer) and tell your personal story.  Whether it is painful, humiliating or blissful, it is truthful.  Be it ordinary, adventurous or colorful, it still belongs to you and me.  Once these stories are threaded, the result is a panoramic account of the Chinese American history.</p>
