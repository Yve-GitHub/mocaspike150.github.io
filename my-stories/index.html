In 2019, Transcontinental Railroad turns 150.  Its construction ushered in a new era of large-scale Chinese immigration to America. Unbeknownst to these Chinese laborers who ventured to this far-off, foreign land, their contributions were key to the construction of the railroad..</P> <!--more-->  

 <p>Meanwhile after a century and a half, the shift in the global social, political and economic landscape redefined the Chinese American experience and aided in the explosion of the Chinese population and socio-economic growth in America. </P>

<p>Over the last 150 years, </p>
<ul>
  <li> the U.S. passed and repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act</li>
<li> WWI and WWII began and ended</li>
<li> Social turmoils following the regime changes from Qing Dynasty to the Republic to the People Republic</li>
<li> The yo-yoing of the ever-changing Sino-American relationship </li>
<li> The explosion in the Chinese American population from tens of thousands to tens of millions </li>
</ul>
<p>
An average human generation is roughly 25 years, giving rise to six generations in 150 years.  It is remarkable that six generations of Chinese Americans have weathered, survived, excelled and grew on the American soil, which was at times acidic and toxic, filled with discrimination and inequality. </p?

<p>History is an account of humankind and humanity is a collection of countless stories of men and women.  </p>

<p>Regardless of the era, Chinese in America are connected by a treasure chest full of stories.  Yet, the rightful claim to uncover and pen the Chinese history in America should fall on shoulder and hands of each Chinese American and our children.  </p>

<p>Founded in 1980, Museum of Chinese in America, MOCA, invites Chinese Americans to open your heart, pick up a pen (or a computer) and write your personal story.  Whether it is painful, humiliating or blissful, it must be truthful.  Be it ordinary, decorated or twisted, it still belongs to you and me.  Once these stories are threaded, the result is a panoramic account of the Chinese American history.</p>
