Founded in 1980, the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) is dedicated to
preserving and presenting the history, heritage, culture and diverse experiences of
people of Chinese descent in the United States. The greatly expanded MOCA at 215
Centre Street is a national home for the precious narratives of diverse Chinese
American communities, and strives to be a model among interactive museums.

美国华人博物馆（MOCA）是目前美国最大的保存华人在美国历史的非营利博物馆。
华人在美国的历史是美国历史的重要组成部分，MOCA一方面收集整理档案资料，
另一方面通过展览教育等项目进行展示和普及。
博物馆坐落于曼哈顿华埠的中央街215号，
由著名的华人建筑师林璎设计，其代表作是在耶鲁大学的本科毕业设计—华盛顿越战墙。
 

The Museum promotes dialogue and understanding among people of all cultural
backgrounds, bringing 160 years of Chinese American history to vivid life through its
innovative exhibitions, educational and cultural programs. MOCA welcomes diverse
visitors and participants to its broad array of exhibits and programs. MOCA’s expansion
accommodates its range of visitors which include: New Yorkers, domestic and
international visitors, neighborhood residents, students and school groups from local
and regional schools.

Last Year, MOCA began participating in the New York City Marathon as a charitable
partner. Our team of seven runners raised $88,000 to support MOCA’s mission. Many
Chinese American running groups and runners learned about our efforts and showed
their support. We are grateful to them for helping to further our mission in presenting
the stories of Chinese Americans! This year we hope to reach a larger demographic
and raise even more money to support our work.

MOCA的纽约马拉松活动自去年开始，其Charity团队由7人组成，为MOCA的建设和运营集资8万8千美元。
当时很多跑团跑者都有听说和支持，在此一并表示感谢！

TCS NYC Marathon MOCA Charity Team 2018

This year will be the 150th anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental
railroad in the United States. To commemorate the contributions of the thousands of
Chinese laborers responsible for this milestone in American history, MOCA has named
its 2019 TCS NYC Marathon fundraising initiative “MOCA Spike 150 - Running Forward
with Our Stories!” We invite fellow runners and non-runners alike to participate in this
initiative. We encourage everyone to help tell the story of some of the first Chinese in
America by helping to support our 2019 marathon team and rewriting history to
acknowledge their contributions.

2019年是美国第一条横贯大陆铁路建成150周年，为了纪念第一批华人来美建设这条铁路所做出的巨大贡献，
MOCA将其2019 TCS NYC Marathon的活动命名为MOCA Spike 150 – Running Forward With Our Stories！
现诚邀各跑团支持参与这个活动，鼓励大家通过马拉松，讲出华人自己的故事，回顾过去，立足现在，
展望未来，共同书写美国历史，使之更加充实完整。


The MOCA Spike 150 initiative is being led by MOCA Board Co-Chair Jonathan Chu
and Bergen Runners founder and Captain Renny Shih. MOCA Spike 150 kicked off
with a pig run, a half marathon course around lower Manhattan in the shape of a pig, to
commemorate the Lunar New Year and will culminate in the MOCA team crossing the
finish line at the 2019 TCS NYC Marathon. During the nearly yearlong initiative, MOCA
will organize a symbolic relay event to represent the building of the railroad that will
involve Chinese American running groups from across the country. In addition to the
symbolic relay we are planning to tell the stories of 150 significant Chinese Americans
or events in Chinese American history, creating a MOCA TCS NYC Marathon runner
database, recruiting runners to participating in the New York City marathon as a
member of the MOCA Team (this participation will not conflict with runner&#39;s Affiliated
Club at NYRR). The funds raised by the MOCA Team will be used to support the
museum in fulfilling its mission of preserving the history of Chinese Americans and
achieving our goal of becoming a nationally recognized institution. We hope that this initiative will unite Chinese Americans from all across the country and shed light on our contributions throughout American history.  

MOCA Spike 150特邀MOCA 董事会联合主席Jonathan Chu和大纽约地区新晋的华人跑群队长Renny Shih共同担任本次活动的 Co-Captain。
整个活动自中国农历新年开始，至纽马推向高潮， 在近一年的活动期间，MOCA将组织全美各地华人跑团的象征性接力活动—
MOCA Spike 150 Relay，讲述不为人知的150个华人历史知识，创建MOCA TCS NYC Marathon跑团跑者档案数据库，
招募参加纽马的华人跑者加入MOCA Charity Team（这个参与不会影响自己所在的Affiliated Club积分），
MOCA Charity Team所筹集的资金将全部用来支持MOCA履行其保存展示美国华人历史的使命，
实现其成为一个国家级博物馆的目标。也希望通过这次活动，将全国各地华人跑团跑者凝聚在一起，用脚步丈量华人在美国的足迹。

In addition, MOCA will send a team to document significant Chinese American events
throughout the country. On May 10 th , 2019 there will be a large 150th anniversary event
scheduled to take place in Utah commemorating the final spike of the Transcontinental
Railroad. At this event MOCA will announce the start of the Spike Relay, and our
participation in the Boston Marathon (April), NJ marathon (April), San Diego Rock n Roll
Marathon (June), Chicago Marathon (October), and the New York City Marathon
(November).

另外，在几个大型活动上，MOCA都会派出核心团队和摄影团队参加，目前暂定的有5月10日在
Transcontinental Railroad落成处的犹他州举办的大型150周年纪念活动，4月的波马和新马，
6月的圣地亚哥摇滚马，10月的芝马，和11月的纽马等。

Kicking off on Feb.10 with 100 runners from 5 local running groups participating in the
pig run, a series of programs will be followed culminating in the MOCA team running the
New York City Marathon. Details are coming soon, please stay tuned! The events and
programs will be posted on a dedicated website. MOCA also plans to document the
initiative and create a documentary to celebrate this momentous occasion. Please join
us as we embark on this long journey 150 years in the making.
