<p>This year will be the 150th anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. To commemorate the contributions of the thousands of Chinese laborers responsible for this milestone in American history, MOCA has named its 2019 TCS NYC Marathon fundraising initiative “<strong>MOCA Spike 150 – Running Forward with Our Stories!</strong>”  We invite fellow runners and non-runners alike to participate in this initiative.  We encourage everyone to help tell the story of some of the first Chinese in America by helping to support our 2019 marathon team and rewriting history to acknowledge their contributions.</p>
<p>The MOCA Spike 150 initiative is being led by MOCA Board Co-Chair Jonathan Chu and Bergen Runners founder and Captain Renny Shih.  MOCA Spike 150 kicked off with a pig run, a half marathon course around lower Manhattan in the shape of a pig, to commemorate the Lunar New Year and will culminate in the MOCA team crossing the finish line at the 2019 TCS NYC Marathon. </p>
<p>During the nearly yearlong initiative, MOCA will organize a symbolic relay event to represent the building of the railroad that will involve Chinese American running groups from across the country.  In addition to the symbolic relay we are planning to tell the stories of 150 significant Chinese Americans or events in Chinese American history, creating a MOCA TCS NYC Marathon runner database, recruiting runners to participating in the New York City marathon as a member of the MOCA Team (this participation will not conflict with runner’s Affiliated Club at NYRR).  The funds raised by the MOCA Team will be used to support the museum in fulfilling its mission of preserving the history of Chinese Americans and achieving our goal of becoming a nationally recognized institution. We hope that this initiative will unite Chinese American from all across the country and show our impact on the grand scheme of Americana.</p>
