After a day of being under the unrelenting Dallas sun, some creatures were lurking in the dark, relieved from the heat that beat down from the heavens above. They ran to their limits, they walked for as long as their feet would take them, and they hopped until their legs gave way and were reduced to only a crawl. They gathered around and feasted on sweet, fleshy-bright red fruit. After showing teeth to the blinding lights, they laughed for taking a lead with the silliest pride. (DASH members were trying to accumulate defining miles in the MOCA event during the last hours of the race to the top.)
