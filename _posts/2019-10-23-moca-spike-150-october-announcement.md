Dear MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador,

First of all, let me express my highest appreciation to all of you for being a MOCA Spike 150 ambassador to support such an unprecedented big running charity event for MOCA. As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad to honor the contribution of Chinese ancestry who toiled and gave their lives to build America into the country it is today, your participation allows MOCA to tell 150 untold stories in the making of America as many of us follow in the footsteps of this country’s first pioneers and run across the finish line in the TCS NYC Marathon on November 3, 2019.

As part of MOCA Spike 150 ambassadors, our important mission is to raise funds to give museum a good financial support to get its own permanent home. As of today, with the combined effort of running clubs and individual runners, we already raised amazing $116,721 and the number is still growing up every day! With TCS New York City Marathon only 10 days away (!), we urge all of ambassadors to share your fundraising page link to help us maximize the fundraising amount. You can all check the latest fundraising progress at our event website <a href="https://www.mocaspike150.org/">https://www.mocaspike150.org/</a>

As stated previously, we will give every individual ambassador who raises more than $500 a limited edition MOCA Spike 150 X PSNY team singlet, specially designed by one of MOCA team runners, Dao-Yi Chow. For all of you reached the amount please contact me ASAP to reserve your team singlet (and we encourage everyone to wear it on the NYC marathon day!). For the rest, you still have time to reach the goal. These singlets have such a symbolic meaning in this special year, you will be wearing it with pride! Also please remember any donor who donates $100 and above can get an annual MOCA membership which gives free access to the museum and enjoy 10% off to shop on the museum store. We will put together the eligible list to receive the membership in early December. 

If you are not sure your fundraising page link, please check <a href="https://www.mocaspike150.org/spike-150-ambassadors/">https://www.mocaspike150.org/spike-150-ambassadors/</a> which lists all the ambassadors with quick links. Also please remember to come to MOCA's NYC Marathon pre-race festival to have some fun celebration together before the big marathon day.

Again, please don't hesitate to <a href="https://www.mocaspike150.org/contactus/">contact us</a> if you have any question. I am looking forward to meeting many of you in the party and on the NYC marathon day!

Cheers,<br>
