<p class="title">Q: What does it mean by being a MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador?</p>
<p>MOCA established in 1980 as a non-profit organization, and since then, MOCA has started its mission of collecting, preserving and interpreting the history of Chinese in America. MOCA has been engaging audiences from all backgrounds to see American history through a critical perspective, to reflect on their own experiences, and to make meaning connections between: the past and the present, the global and the local, themselves and the others. To support MOCA&#8217;s mission, MOCA Spike 150 Ambassadors will fundraise for MOCA to grow through running, help MOCA get a permanent home and become a national museum!</p>
