One day, two shakeout runs! Two special fun run events will be hosted before and after the <a href="/events/2019-10-03-moca-pre-race-festival">MOCA Marathon Pre-Race Festival</a> on Saturday. Both begin and end in MOCA where you can have your bag checked and clothes changed. Join us for a 4 mile pre-race shakeout or a 3 mile easy fun run, take part in a professional photo shoot against the breathtaking and classic backdrop of the New York City skyline!  Donâ€™t forget to wear your MOCA Tee to take part in the photo shooting!
