<p>There will be a picnic gathering right after the training that day in the nearby park, Franklin Lake Park from 10:30-12:30, so that the Chinese runners from NJ can get to know each other and socialize. For the GPS, you can use the address: 21 Lakeview Ave, West Long Branch, NJ 07764. All runners are welcome to join this fantastic event; we are going to have a great time!</p>
