						<p>In 2019, Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) celebrates the 150th anniversary of the historic moment when a golden spike was driven into the ground at Promontory Summit, Utah to mark the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. To honor the thousands of Chinese railroad workers whose contributions have largely gone unnoticed, MOCA is launching a year-long initiative to commemorate and tell the history of Chinese people in the United States over the past 160 years. "<strong>MOCA Spike 150 - Running Forward With Our Stories</strong>" will rally <strong>1,500+</strong> runners across the country to collectively run <strong>150,000+</strong> miles, telling <strong>150+</strong> stories and organizing <strong>15+</strong> special events in order to fundraise to support MOCA’s effort to preserve and present the stories of Chinese in America.</p>

<p>The event will culminate in the TCS NYC Marathon on November 3, 2019. MOCA welcomes you to join us in this unprecedented initiative, and welcomes runners to follow in the footsteps of this country’s first pioneers and make history.</p>
