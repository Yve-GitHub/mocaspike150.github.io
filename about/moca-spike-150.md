title: About MOCA Spike 150
---


The Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) is the largest non-profit museum of its kind in the United States that records the history of Chinese in America. By collecting, persevering, and presenting archival materials, MOCA highlights the historical and cultural contributions of Chinese Americans to the US and the world. The museum is located at 215 Central Street in Manhattan’s Chinatown. The space was designed by the famous Chinese American architect Maya Lin, who also designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC.

**Activity Origin:**

Since its founding in 1980, MOCA has been dedicated to collecting, preserving and demonstrating the history of Chinese in the United States. With strong support from the Chinese community MOCA continues its efforts to become a national museum. In 2018 MOCA ran the TCS NYC marathon as a charity partner. Our team was able to raise $88,000 to support the efforts of the museum. In 2019 MOCA will once again be a charity partner of the marathon. Learning from our experiences last year, we have started this fundraising efforts much earlier this year and decided to ramp it up by organizing a series of runs leading up to the TCS NYC marathon in November.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad. In recognition of the contributions of the thousands of overlooked Chinese workers, MOCA has named its 2019 TCS NYC Marathon fundraising event "MOCA Spike 150 – Running Forward With Our Stories!" We hope that through this series of events to rally Chinese runners from all over the country to run for our own history, and as part of the American history, telling the stories, and changing the Chinese stereotype in the past.

During this year long event, MOCA will record the stories of Chinese running groups and runners, tell the history of Chinese people in the United States over the past 150 years, and create a documentary about the fundraising process.

In February, documentary film maker Kenneth Eng came to New York to conduct interviews with Chinese runners of all ages.

MOCA is now inviting people to join the MOCA Spike 150 series of events. MOCA encourages everyone to run marathons or just run as routine, telling the story of our own, in the past or present, and look to the future, making the history of America integrally.

While all of MOCA’s spots have already been filled, we encourage you to support us in the following ways:

**1. Be a MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador**

The marathon charity run is not only limited to charity runners!

For many runners, the marathon is the result of rigorous training, the realization of self-challenge, the process of meeting a better self, the celebration, the practice, the interweaving of tears and sweat, the finish line and the starting point, which can be self-imposed, and moreover shocking to the people, which is why many people are willing to participate in the marathon charity run for public welfare and fundraising.

The MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador's event is to recruit marathon runners who are willing to share their positive energy and stories and run for MOCA's charity fundraising efforts. The MOCA Spike 150 ambassadors do not have to reach a minimum fundraising amount, and are limited to the TCS NYC Marathon. Every runner who participates in any marathon in 2019 can share the 150 Chinese America historical stories from MOCA Collections. This is an opportunity to support a non-profit organization that preserves the history of Chinese in America. Each runner is a great addition to MOCA team.

If you decide to run a marathon for MOCA, you can participate in online and offline training sessions specially organized by the museum. You will also have priority to attend a carb-loading dinner hosted by MOCA before the NYC Marathon. Runners who have raised more than $500 can get a specially designed MOCA running shirt, and one year MOCA membership along with other perks. The MOCA Spike 150 website will also provide a personal fundraising page for each runner and promote them on social media platforms.

**2. Participate in the national running group relay**

How many Chinese running group are in the United States? Are you willing to participate MOCA Spike 150 and run forward with our own stories?

The Golden Spike Sesquicentennial Celebration and Festival will take place at Promontory Summit, Utah on the 10th of May, during this event MOCA will announce the official launch of a 25-week virtual relay that symbolizes the national celebration on the Chinese contribution of the building of the transcontinental railroad. Our goal is to gather at least 25 Chinese running groups to participate in this event. Each running group will take turns to accumulate the running miles for one week. At the end of each week, we will receive the amount of each

group’s distance, which will then be added to the cumulative total for the relay. As distance is accumulated an icon of a person holding the golden spike will move ahead along the railroad on our website. The running group locations will be highlighted on the map and the story of the running group and members will be told. Each week the participating running group will be highlighted on the home page. If the running group organizes a special group run during the week, uploading group running pictures is strongly recommended. In addition to the participation of running groups, we also welcome anyone to participate as an individual. Every time you run or walk outdoors, your distance and photos can be uploaded to the website as part of the cumulative total.

**3. Participate in MOCA group runs and share information**

Every piece of information and story sharing has more than three times the effectiveness...

Prior to the TCS NYC Marathon in November, MOCA Spike 150 will organize joint group runs in the Greater New York area with the support of local running groups (Kick off New Year Pig Run our first event for Spike 150). Everyone is welcome to participate and support the following events, and share the event information. We will post 150 Chinese American historical stories beginning on April 1st on the MOCA Spike 150 website, one story per weekday for a consistent 30 weeks. Please stay tuned.
