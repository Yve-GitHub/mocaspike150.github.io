Founded in 1980, the [Museum of Chinese in America(MOCA)](http://www.mocanyc.org/) is dedicated to
preserving and presenting the history, heritage, culture and diverse experiences of
people of Chinese descent in the United States. The greatly expanded MOCA at 215
Centre Street is a national home for the precious narratives of diverse Chinese
American communities, and strives to be a model among interactive museums.

The Museum promotes dialogue and understanding among people of all cultural
backgrounds, bringing 160 years of Chinese American history to vivid life through its
innovative exhibitions, educational and cultural programs. MOCA welcomes diverse
visitors and participants to its broad array of exhibits and programs. MOCA’s expansion
accommodates its range of visitors which include: New Yorkers, domestic and
international visitors, neighborhood residents, students and school groups from local
and regional schools.

Last Year, MOCA began participating in the New York City Marathon as a charitable
partner. Our team of seven runners raised $88,000 to support MOCA’s mission. Many
Chinese American running groups and runners learned about our efforts and showed
their support. We are grateful to them for helping to further our mission in presenting
the stories of Chinese Americans! This year we hope to reach a larger demographic
and raise even more fund to support our work.
