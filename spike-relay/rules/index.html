<h4>Attention Running Clubs Across America:  Relay and Run with Our Stories</h4>
<p>2019 marks the 150th anniversary of the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad. To honor the monumental contribution by Chinese laborers to America’s first national railroad systems, the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) proudly presents the &#8220;<strong>MOCA Spike 150 Initiative: Running Forward With Our Stories!</strong>&#8221;  This multi-month charity series which started with an epic lunar New Year Pig Run, kicks off a wave of celebrations that culminate with the TCS New York City Marathon on November 3rd. </p>
<p>On May 10th, the same day that the ceremonial Golden Spike was driven 150 years ago, MOCA will launch Spike 150 Virtual Relay. A relay that spans 25 consecutive weeks, This is a unique MOCA Spike 150 Initiative event.  With the support and participation of running clubs across the country, our hope to cover as much distance as humanly possible.  We look forward to uniting all Chinese American Heritage Running Clubs, help MOCA raise funds toward its permanent museum location, promote the significance of the history of Chinese in America and preserve this piece of history.  We also hope to shatter the Chinese American ’s stereotype impressed by the mass media, so that we get to tell own stories while running forward.</p>
<p>Relay Timing: 5/12/2019 to 11/3/2019, for a total of 25 weeks. </p>
<p>There are three phases in the relay.  Each phase is 8 weeks.  During each phase, clubs must designate one week for their runners to accumulate miles for the club.  The 25th week will be a bonus week (more details below).</p>

<div><a href="https://forms.gle/upjqH8VhktEWZxQR7" class="quicklink" target=_blank>Virtual Relay Sign Up</a></div>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Each participating runner needs to install the Strava app, upload and log all runs during his/her club’s designated weeks of participation, including the bonus week.  Runners of all paces and any distance are welcomed.  </p>
<div class="title-block">How Does It Work</div>
<pThis is a virtual relay. Your club can use the existing Strava club to participate or have Spike 150 setup a Strava club for use of the relay.  Regardless of your location, outdoor or indoor, or distance, once you join the designated club, you will start accumulating the mileage. Please be reminded that you must record your run on Strava for the miles to count! At the end of each week, Strava will tally miles from all participating runners and teams to the total Spike 150 Virtual Relay Miles during each week. Assuming each week is designated by at least one team, “the baton” will be carried on from week to week.  </p>
<p>* Every week’s miles could be accumulated by one or several running clubs which have signed up for the week, each club will be measured by separated Strava club.</p>
<p>* Every week starts from 12am on Monday and ends at 11:59 pm on Sunday, Eastern Time.</p>
<p>* MOCA reserves the right to make adjustment to the weekly sign up based on the overall registration.</p>
<p><div class="title-block">How to Register</div></p>
<p>Between 4/8- 4/21/2019, we invite all the running club leaders to sign up on behalf of their club, and choose the preferred relay weeks. MOCA may request and assign alternative designated week for the club to ensure even and full coverage.  Once the schedule is set, MOCA will create event Strava club for each running club and send out the Strava link and invitation to the leaders. Please ask and invite as many members as possible to join the assigned relay club as there is no limitation on the number of runners.</p>
<p><div class="title-block">Goals of the Virtual Relay</div></p>
<p>To echo the theme of 150th anniversary of the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad, the first goal is to reach 15,000 miles. Using the 1,912 miles of total distance of Transcontinental Railroad as a benchmark, the second goal is to reach at least 15 times of the length of the historical Transcontinental Railroad. </p>
<p>Finally, the total distance of the Spike 150 Virtual Relay is unlimited. Let us run together as a team — reaching further distance and greater heights. Over these 25 weeks, we encourage you share relay information, your stories, promote MOCA, and further promote the intention of this charity event.</p>
<p><strong>After the event, MOCA will archive all information, journey about the Relay and participating clubs to preserve this precious record for the MOCA Spike 150 event and participating running clubs.</strong></p>
<p><div class="title-block">Event Page Design</div></p>
<p>There will be a feature on the event page which dynamically illustrates the construction of the 1,912 miles of the historical Transcontinental Railroad.  The moving Golden Spike symbolizes the baton in our relay. The position of the baton represents the corresponding position on the entire distance. The participating clubs’ miles will bring the Golden Spike to move forward. The Golden Spike will reset to the beginning upon the each completion of total railroad distance, and the counter will increase to track total number of distance and railroad completed.</p>
