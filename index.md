At the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA), a national cultural institution that tells the untold stories in the making of America through the lens of the Chinese immigrant experience, visitors are greeted with the Chinese proverb: *“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”* It is our way of honoring the pioneering spirit of not only Chinese immigrants but all immigrants who sacrificed and dared to take the first step that blazed a path for future generations in America.

With 2019 being the 150th anniversary of the historic moment when a golden spike was driven into the ground at Promontory Summit in Utah to mark the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, the Museum has launched the **MOCA Spike 150 initiative** to not only honor the resilience, grit, and ingenuity symbolized by the thousands of Chinese laborers responsible for this milestone but of all immigrants in America. This nine-month initiative will feature a series of fundraising events, the biggest of which will be the TCS NYC Marathon on November 3 where we are inviting runners to follow in the footsteps of this country's first pioneers and make history by supporting MOCA.

More details coming soon....
