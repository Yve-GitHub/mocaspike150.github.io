<p>MOCA is now inviting people to join the MOCA Spike 150 series of events. MOCA encourages everyone to run marathons or just run as routine, telling the story of our own, in the past or present, and look to the future, making the history of America integrally.</p>
<p>While all of MOCA&#8217;s TCS New York City Marathon charity spots have already been filled, we encourage you to support us in the following ways:</p>
<h4>1. Be a MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador</h4>
<p><em><strong>The marathon charity run is not only limited to charity runners!</strong></em></p>
<p>Are you one of the lucky few who are registered for the 2019 TCS New York City Marathon? If so, join us as a MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador to support the Museum of Chinese in America! The MOCA Spike 150 ambassadors do not have to reach a minimum fundraising amount, your participation will not conflict with your current club affiliation. In fact, it will provide an opportunity for your club to champion a worthy cause!</p>
<p>If you decide to run New York City marathon for MOCA, you can participate in online and offline training sessions specially organized by the museum. You will also have priority to attend a carb-loading dinner hosted by MOCA before the NYC Marathon. Runners who have raised more than $500 can get a specially designed MOCA running shirt, and one year MOCA membership along with other perks. The MOCA Spike 150 website will also provide a personal fundraising page for each runner and promote them on social media platforms.</p>

<p>The MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador&#8217;s event is to recruit marathon runners who are willing to share their positive energy and stories and run for MOCA&#8217;s charity fundraising efforts, and are not limited to the TCS New York City Marathon. Every runner who participates in any marathon in 2019 can share the 150 Chinese America historical stories from MOCA Collections. This is an opportunity to support a non-profit organization that preserves the history of Chinese in America. Each runner is a great addition to MOCA team.</p>

<h4>2. Participate in the MOCA Spike 150 Relay</h4>
<p><em><strong>How many Chinese running clubs are in the United States? Are you willing to participate MOCA Spike 150 and run forward with our own stories?</strong></em></p>
<p>The Golden Spike Sesquicentennial Celebration and Festival will take place at Promontory Summit, Utah on the 10th of May, during this event MOCA will announce the official launch of a 25-week virtual relay that symbolizes the national celebration on the Chinese contribution of the building of the transcontinental railroad. Our goal is to gather at least 25 Chinese running clubs to participate in this event. Each running group will take turns to accumulate the running miles for one week. At the end of each week, we will receive the amount of each Club&#8217;s weekly total distance, which will then be added to the cumulative total for the relay. As distance is accumulated an icon of a golden spike will move ahead along the railroad on our website. The running club locations will be highlighted on the map and the story of the running group and members will be told. Each week the participating running club will be highlighted on the home page. If the running club organizes a special group run during the week, uploading group running pictures is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>In addition to the participation of running groups, we also welcome anyone to participate as an individual. Every time you run or walk outdoors, your distance and photos can be uploaded to the website as part of the cumulative total.</p>
