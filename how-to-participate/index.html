<p>MOCA is now inviting people to join the MOCA Spike 150 series of events. MOCA encourages everyone to run marathons or just run as routine, telling the story of our own, in the past or present, and look to the future, making the history of America integrally.</p>
<p><strong>While all of MOCA’s TCS New York City Marathon charity spots have already been filled</strong>, we encourage you to support us in the following ways:</p>
<h4>1. Be a MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador</h4>
<p><em><strong>The marathon charity run is not only limited to charity runners!</strong></em></p>
<p>Are you one of the lucky few who are registered for the 2019 TCS New York City Marathon? If so, join us as a MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador to support the Museum of Chinese in America! There is no minimum fundraising requirement, your participation will not conflict with your current club affiliation. In fact, it will provide an opportunity for your club to champion a worthy cause!</p>
<p>If you decide to run New York City marathon for MOCA, you can participate in online and offline training sessions specially organized by the museum. You will also have priority to attend a carb-loading party hosted by MOCA before the NYC Marathon. Runners who have raised more than $500 can get a specially designed MOCA running shirt, and one year MOCA membership along with other perks. <a href="tcs-new-york-city-marathon">View details here</a>.</p>

<p>The MOCA Spike 150 Ambassador’s event is to recruit marathon runners who are willing to share their positive energy and stories and run for MOCA’s charity fundraising efforts, and are not limited to the TCS New York City Marathon. Every runner who participates in any marathon in 2019 can join MOCA charity run to fundraise for MOCA. This is an opportunity to support a non-profit organization that preserves the history of Chinese in America. Each runner is a great addition to MOCA team.</p>
